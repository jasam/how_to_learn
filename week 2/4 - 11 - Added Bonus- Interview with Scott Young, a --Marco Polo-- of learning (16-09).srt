1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,160
Scott Young is the ultimate
adventurer in learning.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,630
He's compressed the entire
four year MIT curriculum for

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,260
computer science into one year
of independent learning, and is

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,210
now wrapping up a year's travel, learning
four different languages, Spanish,

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,940
Portuguese, Chinese, and Korean through
total immersion in each of the countries.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,880
Scott doesn't just study learning
from an academic perspective.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,090
He immerses himself in learning and

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,460
perceptively observes the results so
that we can all gain from it.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,460
So, it's a pleasure to
welcome Scott Young.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,680
Scott, I'm always excited
to follow your adventures.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,620
So tell me, where are you now and
what is your latest learning challenge?

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,000
>> Right.
So right now at the moment I'm actually in

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,210
South Korea, in Seoul not too
far away from Gangnam actually.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,780
And I am learning Korean.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,430
And this is part of a larger project where
a friend and I are traveling for a year.

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,680
Staying three months in
four different countries.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,280
So three months each trying
to learn the language of

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,650
that country through not speaking
English as much as possible.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,030
>> Wow.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm just so impressed.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,335
You're sort of a Marco Polo of learning.

22
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:20,900
[LAUGH] And I was also impressed
by your MIT challenge in learning.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,180
What you did was you compressed a four
year curriculum of computer science into

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,870
one year of independent learning.

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,870
There are a lot of questions I have for

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,030
you in relation to that experience as well
as your language learning experience.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,670
So first, can you tell us, how do you
avoid illusions of competence in learning?

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,920
>> Right.
Well, I'm a big fan of trying to dive

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,590
into a position where you might
be wrong as soon as possible.

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,198
So, when you're just reading a lecture,

31
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,260
reading a textbook,
you can't ever really be wrong.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,970
There's no real check on
whether you know what you know.

33
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,900
And, I really like getting into problems
as quickly as possible with a language,

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,140
trying to speak as quickly as possible.

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,690
Or if not speaking quick as
quickly as possible testing my,

36
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,280
my listening comprehension in a,
in a, in a strict way.

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,720
So, with the MIT challenge I,I
would work on problem sets.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,850
And I would do my best to do the problem
sets without having the solutions at hand.

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,790
And try my best on, on any problem and
if I got stuck, if I couldn't finish,

40
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,100
then of course go to the problem and
check to see the solution and learn it.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,720
But I think only if you feel
that grind a bit first,

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,710
if you feel that tension, that stress that
you're not quite sure how to finish it

43
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,520
only then will you really remember
how to do the problem for the future.

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,130
So if you don't have that feeling
of not being sure how to do it and

45
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,630
that strain, I think it is hard
to really improve your knowledge.

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,940
>> But that goes right along with
our own learning philosophy.

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,110
In this course which is test
yourself as frequently as possible.

48
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,780
So, one of the approaches that
you have to learning that I

49
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,370
absolutely love is that
of self explanation.

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,770
Can you explain to our viewers a little
bit what you mean by self explanation?

51
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,680
What, what is it and
what kind of benefits can you get from it?

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,620
>> Right, well I got this idea
reading biography of Richard Feynman.

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,040
He was a Nobel Prize winning physicist,
and

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,520
I forget the exact method that he used
himself, but I remember him talking about,

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,710
you know, being a Nobel prize
winner in theoretical physics.

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,980
He's a smart guy, and he was talking
about a particular academic paper,

57
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,190
a particular concept he didn't understand.

58
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,385
And his approach wasn't
to throw his hands up and

59
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,820
say, well, you know,
I don't get it or, it's too difficult.

60
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,000
But he want through meticulously, not
only trying to understand everything that

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,320
was in that paper, but
of the papers it sourced.

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,910
He read through them very carefully and
combed through them and, and

63
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,100
tried to make sure he understood
all the supporting ideas.

64
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,540
So, for me, I've kind of adapted that into
this idea of taking a blank piece of paper

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,750
out and writing as if I'm trying to teach
someone else what this idea is all about.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,850
Or what this process for solving
a particular type of problem is all about.

67
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,350
Or what it means.

68
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,570
And what I find happens is that you
usually get to points where you

69
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,660
have some friction,
where you have to be too vague or

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,840
you can't really be as exact and
precise as you want to be.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,070
And those are usually the things
that you don't understand.

72
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,030
So you can go back to your notes,
you can go back to the textbook,

73
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,050
look up that exact spot, and figure out,
oh, this is the part I'm missing.

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,870
I'm missing step three of this process.

75
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,120
Or I don't really understand
why step three works,

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,001
maybe I can ask someone,
a teacher or a, or a friend.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,560
>> I think it's so
smart to go look and intuit how

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,970
other very creative people have,
have approached their problem solving.

79
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,340
And I always love Feynman's approach.

80
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,100
He always said that,
that it's very important that, that

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,060
the first rule is not to fool yourself,
but you are the easiest person to fool.

82
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,550
So I, I, I just love how you're,
you're learning from other learners.

83
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,370
Can you, can you

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,230
one of your approaches that I really
like is that of creating vivid examples.

85
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,910
Can you give us an example of that?

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,410
>> So, the mind doesn't learn
abstract things very well.

87
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,080
It works a lot better when you
have something very concrete,

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,640
you can point to it and say,
oh, this is how it works.

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,120
And, math and science is often full of
things that are just pure abstract,

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,710
abstraction, they, they only connect very
loosely to things we can touch and feel.

91
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,340
So what I try to do is find simple
analogies that are, are metaphors and

92
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,790
try to test them or see how to make them
fit with the thing I'm trying to learn.

93
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,990
So it's kind of like looking
through your mind for examples or

94
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,310
stories or things that you
are familiar with, and like, fitting

95
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,960
a jigsaw piece into a puzzle, trying
to figure out, what's the right piece.

96
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,290
So I'll give you a quick example of that.

97
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,860
I was learning about electricity and

98
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,650
one of the concepts you
learn early on is voltage.

99
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,810
Now, I didn't have a good
intuition of what voltage was.

100
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,420
So I'm trying to make a, a mental
picture of what voltage could be, and

101
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm thinking about, you know,
an electrical circuit.

102
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,620
Well, it's a little bit
like pipes with water.

103
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,360
And so if, if the electrical
circuits like pipes with water,

104
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
then what are all of the components?

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,132
And current is pretty easy.

106
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:17,042
Well, that's like the water flowing.

107
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,100
I, I can get that.

108
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,540
But what was voltage, and I was like,
what was it like pressure?

109
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,760
But if you look at the equations for
pressure and you look at the equations for

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,090
voltage, they don't really look alike so
that, that felt wrong.

111
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,200
And I realize that, you know,
if you've studied electricity,

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,420
you've usually also studied the, the,
the, the gravity beforehand, and

113
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,610
what was the same was electric
potential and gravitational potential.

114
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,860
So, oh, voltage is like height.

115
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,790
So I can imagine in my head
that the high voltage wires

116
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,860
are like pipes that are physically
higher than the other pipes.

117
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,220
So the way water when it rushes down,
when it goes down from the high level to

118
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,830
the low level, it gives off a lot
more energy because it's falling.

119
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,160
And that metaphor really helped
me because not only was it

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,642
something concrete that I'll never forget,
but it also was fairly accurate.

121
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:09,160
And then I tested out a couple things
like pressure and I found, okay,

122
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,580
this is the one that works.

123
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,862
And sometimes, this process
can take a little bit of time.

124
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,587
I'm recapping this in two seconds, but

125
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:19,420
it really took me about an hour to comb
through the notes to figure this one out.

126
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,480
But.

127
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,280
You can ask professors, you can ask,
you know, hey, is this kind of like this?

128
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,940
And someone who really
understands can help you out.

129
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,600
Or you can just do what I did and just
try to fit different puzzle pieces and

130
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,280
see what fits.

131
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,140
Because even if you don't
find a good puzzle piece,

132
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,669
you can still learn a lot more that way.

133
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,580
>> Oh I, I couldn't agree more.

134
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,570
I do find that as the years have gone by,
the most creative professors who

135
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,800
I've worked with, researchers, are always
the ones who use these kinds of analogies.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,420
And the ones who are more pedantic,
a little more by the book,

137
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,830
often aren't as creative about
how they approach things.

138
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,570
So I think that's a very intelligent
way of, of going at everything.

139
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,830
Can you talk to our viewers just
a little bit about motivation?

140
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,600
How can you develop a passion for

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,360
learning, perhaps even in subjects you
think you don't have a passion for?

142
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,570
Any suggestions for

143
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,700
mental tools people can use to help
motivate themselves in their learning?

144
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,490
>> Well, I love this question, because
right now I'm learning languages, and

145
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,970
we're currently, I'm currently learning
my sixth language, Korean right now.

146
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,670
And we're doing it in very
tight time constraints.

147
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,680
So I've gotten a few emails
from people who have,

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,290
you know, heard about the project,
and they said, well, maybe you and

149
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,980
your friend who were doing this have
this natural talent for languages and,

150
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,310
you know, this, this genetic gift.

151
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,150
And I think it's so

152
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,280
funny, because I remember, the first time
I was trying to learn a foreign language,

153
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,460
French, I spent about the same
amount of time I'm spending here.

154
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,381
And I barely passed the exam.

155
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,670
[LAUGH] I got a D.

156
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,950
And I'm, I feel like I'm a fairly
smart fellow in other things.

157
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,540
So I didn't really let it get to me.

158
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,160
But I think, it's true for
a lot of subjects.

159
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,870
That, being intelligent within
that subject is often a factor,

160
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,100
just how much exposure you've had to it.

161
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,260
So if you're not used to math, don't take
that as a sign that maybe you're bad at

162
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,690
math, but
just that you need to put more time in.

163
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,400
And you'll get more motivation, it'll
be even more easy to motivate yourself,

164
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,770
you'll have more interest
once you're better at it.

165
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,370
And you can get better at it by,

166
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,110
by encouraging yourself to take on
little steps, little mini projects.

167
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,710
And once you complete that project,
you build more confidence.

168
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,232
With more confidence, you can do more
things, you can understand more things and

169
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:32,680
it becomes more interesting.

170
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,000
And I just, I love your story that
you gave of, of learning math,

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,250
because I think that's
just a perfect example and

172
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,190
it's too bad that a lot of people just
don't conceptualize the world that way.

173
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,850
One thing that I really like about
your own story is, you failed, but

174
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,620
you just learned from failure.

175
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,430
You didn't allow that to get to you.

176
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,690
You just sort of shifted
your strategies and

177
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,970
figured out what strategy
was more successful.

178
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,925
And I think that's a sign of
the best learners, is not to be set,

179
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:04,410
set back by failure,
they just learn from it.

180
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,170
>> Absolutely.

181
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,277
>> So, I, I love how you've developed
projects for self education.

182
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,630
Can you tell us a little more about
what you've done this way and

183
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,670
how our viewers might go about developing
their own projects for self education?

184
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,720
>> Right, so I actually got
this idea from a good friend.

185
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,690
He's also in, I think,
your recommended resources, Benny Lewis.

186
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,430
And he was someone who told me I
remember he told me in person one day,

187
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,000
he's like, always have a mission.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,680
And basically just this idea of, he, he
would pick these three month missions for

189
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,352
learning languages, because that was
usually how long he could secure a tourist

190
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,840
visa [LAUGH] to this place to try to learn
as much as possible in three months.

191
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,896
But it really struck me how different
that was from the regular approach.

192
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:52,400
The regular approach of going, and you
know, I'm going to just learn this and I

193
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,140
don't really have any concrete goals and I
don't really have any specific motivation.

194
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,450
And of course it tapers off and
you don't achieve that much.

195
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,350
And what I found really helpful is
making very concrete projects that

196
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,210
are exciting to me.

197
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,580
Something that, you know,
this is really interesting.

198
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,920
So when I did the MIT Challenge,
just this idea kind of obsessed me.

199
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,940
This idea of, you know, would it be
possible to learn the things that

200
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,590
an MIT student would learn in
school without going to MIT?

201
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,660
Or this language learning project,
you know.

202
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,680
Would it be possible to get to
a conversational level, or, or a decent

203
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,490
amount of level through complete immersion
in four different countries in a year?

204
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,030
So I, I tend to pick these
kind of grand projects.

205
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,000
But I think you could pick
something very simple.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,220
You could just say, you know,
I want to try learning this over a month.

207
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,920
And I'm going to obsess about it and
make it interesting.

208
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,550
And that's often how you can turn
something that might otherwise be

209
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,380
dull into something that fascinates you,

210
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,840
because it's this specific
concrete challenge.

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,820
>> I like this approach.

212
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,610
It seems very similar to what I did
with helping to create this MOOC.

213
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,600
So, yeah.

214
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,610
>> Yeah.

215
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,860
>> Any tips on effective
use of online resources?

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
Right.
So,

217
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,600
this is I think particularly relevant
to your audience, because you know,

218
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,400
a MOOC audience you're signed up
to this through Co, Coursera and

219
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,520
you probably know about Coursera and
edX and all of the great MOOC platforms.

220
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,620
And I really think these platforms
are the future because they

221
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,439
have such high quality courses,
but it's still early days.

222
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,390
And I think that there's still a lot
of subjects that people would like to

223
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,940
learn but maybe there isn't a MOOC for it.

224
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,950
And I think there's also
some disadvantages to MOOCs.

225
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,910
In particular if you want to
learn something a little bit

226
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,410
more advanced MOOCs can sometimes be a bit
harder because they tend to be written for

227
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,070
audience with no prerequisites,
no requirements.

228
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,174
So you might feel that if you wanted
to do, you know, some physics it

229
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:49,040
isn't just an intro physics class, this
is a little bit harder, because you know,

230
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,545
they are expecting that I
haven't learned calculus or

231
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,516
I haven't learned something different.

232
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:58,460
And so what I recommend is using
MIT's open course ware's incredible.

233
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,880
It has literally hundreds, I don't know
whether it has thousands of courses, but

234
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,540
it has just such a huge volume of courses.

235
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,630
And sometimes the courses aren't
really well supported, like they

236
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,690
don't have videos, they don't have,
it's not as hands-on as, as these MOOCs.

237
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,650
But I've found sometimes what they'll have
is they'll have the exams in the problem

238
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,770
sets and a list of the readings,
and a link to a textbook.

239
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,720
I can buy the textbook used on Amazon for
$15 sometimes.

240
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,150
And I'd get it delivered, and
I would do it, and honestly I felt like I

241
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,930
sometimes learned more from those
courses than the video lecture courses.

242
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,030
So I think if you are willing
to be bit more adventurous,

243
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,492
there's literally almost no topic
you can't learn through this kind of

244
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:43,760
structured, university-like format
through the resources available online.

245
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,490
>> It's an explosion in
learning how to learn.

246
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,810
I mean this, the what's available now to
the public is just absolutely phenomenal.

247
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,720
And so anyone who has an interest
in pretty much anything can,

248
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,630
can do some great exploration.

249
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,230
So as our, our wrap up question here,

250
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,920
you've written that you,
you can learn more by studying less.

251
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,034
What do you mean by that?

252
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:10,749
>> All right, so

253
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,396
I think you've touched on it a lot
in this course that you're offering.

254
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:19,356
That people get caught up in low
efficiency, low intensity studying habits,

255
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:23,416
and because they learn a lot slower
with those methods they end up

256
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,690
spending a lot more time studying.

257
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,750
And because they're spending
a lot more times studying,

258
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,960
which is naturally more tiring, you go
into less efficient studying methods.

259
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,508
It's a little bit like exercising.

260
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:38,050
It's as if, you know, you're not getting
the exercise results you want, so

261
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,220
you extend your workout
from one hour to two hour.

262
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,620
But now you're not working out as,
more intensely, so you make it four hours.

263
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,900
And now, you know, you really can't do
more than just a light jog for four hours,

264
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,270
or maybe just walking.

265
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,252
And eventually,
it eats up all of your time.

266
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:55,050
But you're, you're not having
the intensity that your muscles in

267
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,700
your body really need to
get physical improvement.

268
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,770
And similarly, I think the same
is true with mental improvement.

269
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,310
So what I try to do is,

270
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,170
I try to pick specific chunks
of time that I'm going to study.

271
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,800
And they don't have to be too big.

272
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,690
So right now, I'm learning Korean
over at least three months.

273
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,650
And I'm actually only doing
three to four hours a day.

274
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,780
Of studying time,
which is considerably less than I

275
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,670
would say a typical full-time
student studying Korean.

276
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,590
But I think that I've been
making quite good progress just

277
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,920
because the actual time I'm
spending is highly focused.

278
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,650
This kind of test yourself feedback so

279
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,480
that I'm using things like Anki for
flashcards.

280
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,190
And I'm doing actual conversations
one-on-one with a tutor.

281
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,770
And these things are very efficient,
but they are also very intense.

282
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:46,200
But the benefit of that is that you have
more time and you can relax outside of it.

283
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,870
>> Great advice and as always,
great advice from you.

284
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,480
I know I've learned a lot and really
enjoyed following your adventures and,

285
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,060
and getting new tips on learning from you.

286
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,380
So I thank you so much, Scott.

287
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,260
And we'll see you on the flip side.

288
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,940
>> Well, thank you very much for
letting me be a part of this.

289
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,080
I, I really hope the students taking
this course found some value in it,

290
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,030
the video I put together.
