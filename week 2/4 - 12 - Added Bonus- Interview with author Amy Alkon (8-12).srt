00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,820
Amy Alkon, is a nationally syndicated
newspaper columnist

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,550
radio show host, journalist, book author
and blogger.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,960
She turns reporting on evolutionary

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,180
psychology and behavioral science
findings, into

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,150
an art form, combining great writing with
deep, yet humorous insight.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,730
The result provides terrific and practical
advice

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,370
for how ordinary people can live better
lives.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,955
Amy's books, I See Rude People, and most
recently, Good

9
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:37,550
Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say
the F word.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,440
Has helped create a new genre,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,410
of insightful humor based on practical
science.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,990
Amy may be, as the L.A Weekly put it, Miss
Manners with Things, but I

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,210
tend to think of her as the

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,590
literary daughter of Charles Darwin, and
Dorothy Parker.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,740
In Amy's work, she's forced to learn fast,
reading a new book every other day

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,230
or so, even as she's keeping up with her
voluminous writing and radio show hosting.

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,980
She has a great deal of insight about
efficient learning, so

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,930
it's a pleasure to speak with her today,
about her work.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,190
Hi Amy, thanks so much for taking time
from your busy schedule.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,180
We know, we both know we're both writers,
that writing

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,700
is a form of learning and so what I'd like

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,780
to know is, how do use the focused and
diffuse

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,120
modes to help you with your writing and
with your learning.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,730
>> I'm normally very focused in my
writing.

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,090
It's a very intense process for me, every
hour of writing and so I need to take a

26
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,760
break from that, in order to really have
the information be assimilated into me.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,450
And so, what I like to do is to see that I
work every day little by little.

28
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,720
On a, on a piece of work that I'm doing.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,100
Because then, in the background, when I'm

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,800
sleeping, when I'm washing dishes, when
I'm

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,930
doing something other than writing, that
information

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,220
has a chance to process in my brain.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,420
And that's a very important thing for me.

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,270
I used to sometimes wait, until the last

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,720
minute to start writing my weekly advice
column.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,560
And this is a huge mistake, because I
would

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,490
fail to take advantage of the diffuse mode,
where

38
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,260
I would have these sort of elves in my

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,640
brain, taking the information, running
around, doing something with it.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,430
And processing it, instead I would just be
all last minute and I

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,325
really wasn't as smart in my writing or my
thinking because of that.

42
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,450
because I didn't have that extra time.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,530
And it wasn't actual so much it wasn't
that I spent so much time, doing

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,160
extra work it was just doing it days ahead
of time that really made a difference.

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,560
>> That sounds like a lot like the way I
approach writing as well.

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,620
Well tell me this, what do you do to help
prevent procrastination when

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,850
you have the kind of writing job that you
really rather not be doing.

48
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,860
>> Well all writing jobs are jobs I'd
rather not be doing.

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,330
It sometimes you have a beautiful
paragraph, it just goes

50
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,010
like butter, it's wonderful, it's funny,
it's all together and clear.

51
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,250
But usually that's not the case.

52
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,060
And so usually knowing that, I would
rather do just about anything than write.

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the time I sit down to write and

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,160
I think about lint that must be lurking
behind my furniture.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,220
So, what I do is I turn on a timer.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,890
I set the timer for an hour, I

57
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,290
know other people use different, different
times 20 minutes,

58
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,910
the Pomodoro but I like the hour because

59
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,100
that gives me enough time to get into
flow.

60
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,680
A flow state where I, maybe can lose
myself in the work.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,540
And sometimes I'll get going and I just
feel dumb and like

62
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,770
I'm making no progress, but I start typing
and I start thinking

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,520
and eventually something will come and I
usually do get to that

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,300
state where I get lost in my work and
something really wonderful happens.

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,140
But you really need to put in that time
like that.

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,509
And not go clean behind your furniture in
order to make the work really work.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,250
>> You keep a very fast paced reading
schedule, on

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,650
top of your regular work, that many people
would find daunting.

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,510
How do you do it and do you have any

70
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,560
special advice for picking out and
remembering key points in books?

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,430
>> Well one of the really important things
I learned.

72
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,180
I used to read whole books even if they
were boring and terrible.

73
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,470
And I was reading War and Peace and every
other chapter, Napoleon is there, they're

74
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,940
cold, they're feet are wet, and it would,

75
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
these, these chapters were just boring to
me.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,660
So I realized it's okay to skip parts of
books, and

77
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,170
so now, I approach a book like I do a
buffet.

78
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,420
And I, I take the things from it that are
important

79
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,120
to me and I skip, I skip the parts that
are not.

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,880
So, when I say I read probably a book a

81
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,970
night, but I don't read the whole book in
every case.

82
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,630
Some of them I just open and I see they're

83
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,210
not worth very much and I close them right
away.

84
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,400
But I think it's very important to even
when you're reading

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,330
a chapter, if you see a story you've
already read it.

86
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,700
If you read a lot of science you, you'll

87
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,780
read research that you've read a million
times before.

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,870
I just, lop that off the chapter and move
on

89
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,040
to the stuff that I don't know and haven't
read.

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,950
I think it's really important to be a
critical reader in that way.

91
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,000
And then, the other question you asked me.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,610
So you asked how do.

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,810
What was the second question?

94
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,256
Sorry.

95
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,450
>> [LAUGH] Do you have any special advice

96
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,300
for picking out and remembering key points
in books?

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,840
>> Well, there aren't so many key points
in books.

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,960
And sometimes when a book is very
important to me or a point is very important.

99
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,140
What I'll do is I'll write it down.

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,400
It's really important, writing something
down with

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,440
an actual pen and ink, remember those?

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,310
it, it seems to ingrain it into your brain
better.

103
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,040
And then what I do, and this maybe seems

104
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,690
funny, I tape it on the wall outside my
shower.

105
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,500
And I can see it from when I'm in there.

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,170
And so, I can look at that idea when I'm

107
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,110
there and this is sort of a diffuse mode
of thinking.

108
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,820
I'm not really focused on it and I'm not
as intense

109
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,690
as I am when I'm reading the book, but
it's just there.

110
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,070
So, I can think about it in a sort of less
intense way and, and

111
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,910
it helps me ingrain an idea that maybe is
a difficult idea to,otherwise, get.

112
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,160
>> Any particular tips on how you learn
most efficiently?

113
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,360
>> I will when I read a passage that I
don't quite get, I'll read it a

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
few times because sometimes the first
time, you miss

115
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
things or it's the language you're not
used to.

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,030
So that's pretty important.

117
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,730
Another thing I'll do, is go to other
reference material.

118
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,810
Because sometimes someone is a poor
writer, but has some really good ideas.

119
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,990
So if I can understand the things they
don't

120
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,060
explain well, then I can maybe understand
their idea better.

121
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,940
>> That makes sense.

122
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,320
finally, do you have any tips related to
sleep.

123
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,440
I love sleep.

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,690
I do about six things well, and one of
them is napping.

125
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,010
And this was not always the case.

126
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,680
I took a yoga class, which I, I hate yoga,
it

127
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,920
was horrible, but the thing I learned to
do was to breathe.

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,940
I learned to slow down my breathing.

129
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,270
And so, in order to sleep.

130
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,390
I just slow down my breathing.

131
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:25,450
I'll take, ten really really slow breaths,
and I use that to slow myself down

132
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,140
so I can fall asleep and something very
important is not to sleep for too long.

133
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,260
Because if you sleep for too long, you can
actually get groggy.

134
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,170
So, I set my alarm clock for about 30
minutes and about five minutes of that

135
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,740
is getting my dog to come down, because

136
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,380
she sleeps with her little snout on my
neck.

137
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,970
And she's only five pounds.

138
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,010
She's not a Great Dane.

139
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,580
[LAUGH] So, I, I then sleep for maybe 20
minutes, which seems

140
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,650
to be a very good amount of time to give
you a reboot.

141
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,910
Rather than make you groggy.

142
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,330
>> That all sounds great, and Amy, thank

143
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,080
you so very much for all of these
insights.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm sure they'll be particularly helpful
for the writers among us.

145
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,870
So thank you so very much.
