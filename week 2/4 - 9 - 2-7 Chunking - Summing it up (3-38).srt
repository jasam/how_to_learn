00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:05,544
[SOUND] In this video, I'm going to
synthesize

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:10,451
some of the main ideas of this week's
videos.

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:14,980
In other words, we'll chunk our week on
chunking.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,230
Here we go.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,400
Chunks are pieces of information,
neuroscientifically speaking, that

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,050
are bound together through use and often
through meaning.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,680
You can think of a chunk as a
scintillating

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,500
network of neurons that compactly
synthesizes key ideas or actions.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Chunks can get bigger and more complex.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,980
But at the same time, they're a single
easy to access item that

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,490
you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on
your working memory.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,400
Chunks are best built with focused,

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,130
undivided attention, understanding of the
basic idea.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,400
And practice to help deepen your patterns
and to help you gain big picture context.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,840
Simple recall, trying to remember the key
points without looking at the

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,530
page, is one of the best ways to help the
chunking process along.

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,160
It seems to help build neural hooks.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,910
They help you better understand the
material.

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,590
Also try recalling material in places that

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,330
are different from where you originally
learned the

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,610
material, so it becomes more deeply
ingrained

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,050
and accessible, regardless of what room
you're in.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,090
This can be very helpful for tests.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,050
Transfer is the idea that a chunk you've
mastered in one area can often help

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,970
you much more easily learn chunks of
information

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,750
in different areas that can share
surprising commonalities.

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,920
Interleave your learning by practicing
your choice of

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,420
different concepts, approach, and
techniques all in one session.

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,840
Chunks are very important, but they don't
necessarily build flexibility, which

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,990
is also important in becoming an expert
with the material you're learning.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
Illusions of competence in learning.

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,430
Learn to recognize when you're fooling
yourself

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,550
about whether you're actually learning the
material.

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,828
Test yourself frequently.

35
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:15,110
Using little mini-tests to see whether
you're actually learning the material, or

36
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,650
whether you've been fooling yourself,
thinking

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,200
you're learning when you're actually not.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Recall is actually a form of mini-testing.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,730
Try to avoid depending too much on
highlighting, which can fool you into

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,280
thinking that the material is going into
your brain when it actually isn't.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,430
Mistakes are a good thing to make when
you're learning.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,490
They allow you to catch illusions of
competence.

43
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,370
Avoid practicing only the easy stuff,
which can

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,960
bring the illusion that you've mastered
the material.

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,320
Deliberately practice what you find more
difficult

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,530
to gain full mastery of the material.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,000
Einstellung is when your initial thought,
an idea

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,570
you've already had in mind, or a neural

49
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,420
pattern you've already developed well and
strengthened, prevents

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,900
a better idea or solution from being
found.

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,030
Or keeps you from being flexible enough

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,620
to accept new, better, or more appropriate
solutions.

53
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,750
The Law of Serendipity is helpful.

54
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,890
Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,150
Just pick one tiny thing out to learn,
then another.

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,890
Just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly
surprised at the results.

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm Barbara Oakley.

58
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,304
Thanks for learning about learning.
