00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,530
In this video, we're going to give you

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,800
a little background about how to make a
chunk.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,560
If you're learning to play a difficult

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,970
song on the guitar, the neural
representation

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,650
of the song in your mind can be considered
as a rather large chunk.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,130
You would first listen to the song.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,100
Maybe you'd even watch someone else
playing the song especially if you were

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,780
just a beginner who was learning things
like, how to hold the guitar.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,520
Getting an initial sense of the pattern
you want to

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,940
master for yourself is similar for most
subjects or skills.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,470
You often have to grasp little bits of
songs that become

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,690
neuro mini-chunks, which will later join
together into larger chunks.

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,440
For example, over several days, you might
learn how to smoothly

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,780
place the musical passages on a guitar,
and when you've grasped

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,020
those passages, you could join them
together with other passages that

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,440
you've learned, gradually putting
everything together

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,500
so you can play the song.

18
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,480
In learning a sport, say basketball,
soccer, golf.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,290
You grasp and master various bits and
pieces of the skills you need.

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,840
You're creating little neural mini-chunks,
that you

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,090
can then gradually knit together into
larger neural chunks.

22
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,980
Later you can hit those larger chunks into
still larger

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,750
and more complex chunks that you can draw
up in

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,310
an instant, in reaction to say to a
slight, shift

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,040
and twist in a soccer ball that's coming
your way.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,220
The best chunks are the ones that are so
well ingrained, that

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,890
you don't even have to consciously

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,500
think about connecting the neural pattern
together.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,960
That, actually, is the point of making
complex

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,580
ideas, movements or reactions into a
single chunk.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,170
You can see this in language learning.

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,570
In the beginning often just saying a
single word with the

33
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,340
proper nuance, tone and accent involves a
lot of practice.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,320
Stringing extemporaneous sentences together
involves the ability to creatively

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,060
mix together various complex mini-chunks
and chunks in the new language.

36
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,090
To see what I mean, try repeating the

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,190
following tongue-twister in the Indian
language of Kannada.

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,360
>> Hi, I am Shilpa Konkani.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,180
I am native speaker of Kannada which is

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,720
one of the oldest language spoken in
India.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,480
Today, I'm going share you a
tongue-twister in Kannada.

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,560
So let's get started.

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Terikere yri male muru kari kurimari meyuthiddavu.
>> Not easy, is it?

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,540
Unless you are a native

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,390
speaker of Kannada,

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,920
but the language was

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,470
learned bit by bit.

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,500
Learning in math and science involves the
same approach.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,360
When you're learning new math and science
material,

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
you're often given sample problems with
worked out solutions.

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
This is because, when you're first trying
to understand how

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,070
to work a problem, you have a heavy
cognitive load.

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,780
So it helps to start out with a work
through example.

54
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,230
It's like first listening to a song before
trying to play the song yourself.

55
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,730
Most of the details of the work out
solution are right there, and your

56
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,270
job is simply to figure out why the steps
are taken the way they are.

57
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,410
They can help you see the key features,
and underline principles of a problem.

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,000
One concern about using worked out
examples in math and science to help you

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,530
in starting to form chunks, is that it can
be all too easy to focus too

60
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,500
much on why an individual step works and
not on the connection between steps.

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,260
That is,

62
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,760
On why this particular step is the next
thing you should do.

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,850
So keep in mind that I'm not just talking
about

64
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,370
a cookie-cutter, just-do-as-you're told,
mindless

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,250
approach when following a worked-out
solution.

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,440
It's more like using a road map to help
you when traveling to a new place.

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,020
Pay attention to what's going on around
you when you're using the

68
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,550
map, and soon you'll find yourself able to
get there on your own.

69
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,780
You'll even be able to figure out new ways
of getting there.

70
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,960
Next, we'll walk you through the actual
steps of chunk formation.

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm Barbara Oakley.

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,810
Thanks for learning how to learn.

#Hey little girl sometimes the times get
hard but soon

#the storm will pass and you'll be playing

#Hey little girl sometimes you might feel
sad but some

bad. Just part of growing up.#
