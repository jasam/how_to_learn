2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:08,003
For this interview, it's a pleasure to
introduce

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,745
you to one of today's leading figures in
learning

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,205
how to learn more effectively, Dr. Norman
Fortenberry, the

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:18,210
executive director of the American Society
of Engineering Education.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,800
Dr. Fortenberry is MIT cubed.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,900
That is, he has his bachelors, masters,
and doctorate

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,720
in mechanical engineering from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,290
Because of his interest in learning,
Norman took an unusual career path.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,870
After teaching his first engineering
classes,

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,180
he realized that there was the disconnect.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,760
He knew a great deal about his research
area,

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,400
but he didn't know about how to teach
effectively.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,840
The reality is, that most new professors
arrive at

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,624
their universities without any training in
how to teach effectively.

16
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:57,520
Dr. Fortenberry wanted to do something
about this problem.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,370
His work at the National Science
Foundation and the National

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,650
Consortium for Graduate Degrees for
Minorities in Engineering and Science have

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,000
helped create a whole network of support
for faculty in science,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,390
engineering, math, and technology who want
to help students learn effectively.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,216
In this interview, we'll get some
practical ideas from Dr.

22
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:21,930
Fortenberry on how you can most
effectively approach your studies.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,750
Thank you so much for being here, Dr.
Fortenberry.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,930
I'm just so impressed.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,210
I have to ask you.

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,350
Here you are.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,720
You landed at MIT, which is one of the

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,310
top educational institutions, at least
technologically-speaking, in the world.

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,840
And you successfully climbed your way up
the

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,860
ladder all the way through to get your
PhD.

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,680
Let's cut past the generalities and get to
specifics.

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,220
What were some of the most, most
worthwhile tricks and approaches

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,920
that you used to help you study and learn
most effectively?

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,850
>> Well, MIT is, is a very good
institution and not just technologically.

35
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,465
For example, it has one of the

36
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:03,183
top political science departments in the
world.

37
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:06,953
But, that said, the techniques that, that
I pursued, the first and foremost

38
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:10,670
was to recognize that what worked in high
school will not work in college.

39
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,797
In high school, you're taught to, well
actually, most of Pre-K,

40
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:17,010
you're taught you're to do your own work,
study alone, etc.

41
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,390
That is deadly.

42
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,730
In college, at least in engineering
schools, the

43
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,090
expectation is that you're part of a
group.

44
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,110
The expectation is that there are course
notes

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,600
and course bibles that are all over
campus.

46
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,720
There's an expectation that you have
access to resources that

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,530
if you don't have access to, you're in
deep trouble.

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,340
So you have to make sure that you live up
to that expectation by

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,030
making the connections to the people who

50
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,370
have the resources that you need to
succeed.

51
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,410
The key lesson in, in collegiate study, at
least

52
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,940
in engineering school, is you are part of
a team.

53
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,120
And if you don't have a team, you find a
team.

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,230
If you are a team, you maximize the team.

55
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,710
But you have to be part of the group.

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,120
Engineering is a team sport.

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680
You know, all the, all the stereotypes

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,300
are about the lone engineer, the lone
programmer.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,550
But it's a team sport.

60
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,960
And you have to find your team as quickly
as possible and make sure

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,770
that the members of that team are very
serious about their studies as well.

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,530
>> Okay.

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,560
Your competition at MIT included some of
the top students in the world.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
How did your, you approach your studies so
that you could

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,290
find things in a way to keep yourself from
being intimidated.

66
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,430
>> I was intimidated.

67
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,769
I was extremely intimidated.

68
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,335
What it took was reminding myself and
having

69
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:35,840
others remind me, my peers, some of the

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,790
administrators, to remind me that I didn't
suddenly

71
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,810
become less smart once I got to MIT.

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,900
There were some extremely bright people,
but I was one of those bright people.

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,596
And that I needed to build a community of
support around me.

74
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,900
I gave support.

75
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,820
I received support.

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,640
So yes, you are entirely intimidated.

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,060
At least I was, and people I knew were.

78
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,970
But we knew that if we worked together as
a team, we would make it through.

79
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,540
And so, that was they key was to remember
the objective is to learn the material.

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,450
The objective is to finish the class.

81
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,060
Even in grad school, the objective is to
get the degree.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,570
And you keep your eye focused on the
prize,

83
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,610
and you fight it out, and you get through.

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,315
>> Early on in your college career, you
took a more advanced calculus course-

85
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:26,450
>> Yes.

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,190
>> That most people don't usually take, at
least at that stage.

87
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,470
I understand this set you back in your
studies.

88
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,060
>> Yes it did.

89
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,530
>> How could you have avoided this
scenario, and how did

90
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,720
you keep going in the face of facing
failure and, and hardship?

91
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,350
>> Well the, the way to avoid the problem
is

92
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,810
to, is to, so this is all about balancing
ego.

93
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,811
I should have done what the overwhelming
majority

94
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:55,386
of students did, which was take the
regular

95
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,031
track calculus and not take the Calculus
with

96
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,457
Applications, which everybody said was the
hard track.

97
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,333
But I said, but it has application, so if
I'm

98
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,367
going to be an engineer that makes sense
for me to do.

99
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:09,230
There are times when there's wisdom in the
wisdom of the crowd.

100
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,500
There are times when being lemming is not
the brightest thing in the world to do.

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,340
The challenge is figuring out which is
which.

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,650
But I think I could have informed my
decision by not only

103
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,350
talking to my peers, but talking to some
grad students and some

104
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,410
administrators, you know, counseling
deans, et cetera, about that choice and my

105
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,412
background in calculus, which was not

106
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,820
strong because I hadn't taken calculus
before.

107
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,590
I was handed an AP book and that was,

108
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,480
that was my calculus class senior year in
Louisiana.

109
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,970
so, so the, the thing is to recognize when
one is making

110
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,920
a reasonable choice and when one is not
making a reasonable choice.

111
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,100
Now, how did I persist?

112
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,598
I buckled down and studied very hard,
again with the study groups.

113
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:01,950
And I spent a lot of extra time going over
material,

114
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,370
two and three different ways to make sure
that I understood it.

115
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,650
>> Okay, so what do you do to help prompt,
sort of, what we call

116
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,000
diffuse mode or neural resting states, the
fresh

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,860
perspectives you get from those kinds of
states.

118
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,900
In your, your research, in your work, how
do you, how do you prompt those?

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,474
>> Well I think it's very important, the
point that you make.

120
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,983
One of the stories that I tell people is
that,

121
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,520
you know, it's okay to keep your nose to
the grindstone.

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
There are plenty of people, at that point,
talking

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,360
about MIT, plenty of people walking around
with no noses.

124
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,270
But if you keep your nose to the

125
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,850
grindstone too long, you begin to cut into
brain.

126
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,130
And since brain is what you're trying to
use, that's counterproductive.

127
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,040
So it is important to take a break.

128
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:52,520
My breaks involve total mental turn-off.

129
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,730
I wa, I read cartoons in the, in the
newspaper or watch cartoons on television.

130
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:03,250
I watch some of the, now, I watch some of
the silliest, most inane,

131
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,540
television shows, as a form, without
naming any names, as a form of relaxation.

132
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,000
That allows me to turn off my conscious
brain, your unconscious work.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,570
It's a lot like taking a nap.

134
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,100
You know, there's so many things coming at
you and pushing on you, that you have to

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,790
redirect your focus in order for your
brain to

136
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,520
work on background and come up with the
answers.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,897
So, so, I do things.

138
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,321
Some people exercise.

139
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,961
I used to exercise more.

140
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,600
I need to exercise more.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,130
But I do things that shut my brain down in
different ways.

142
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,800
>> Well, we share a little, my guilty
pleasure

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,252
is, I, I love to read the National
Enquirer.

144
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,510
[LAUGH].

145
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,530
>> That would work, too.

146
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,850
>> Many of our viewers have brothers and
sisters

147
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,390
and friends who are trying to learn new
things.

148
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,650
So, reflecting back on your own childhood,
and even your

149
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,160
work today, how have other people helped
you in your learning?

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,240
And, did, did people sometimes help you,
perhaps, by not helping you?

151
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,720
And, do you have any practical suggestions
for our

152
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,170
viewers, who are trying to learn how to
learn?

153
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,652
>> There's very practical guidance on
learning how to learn in, in any number

154
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:16,853
of publications and online in, in terms

155
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:20,918
of a, a systematic process for acquiring
information.

156
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,985
Some things I used with my son when he was
younger, in

157
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:27,980
terms of using as many different modes of
input as you can.

158
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,560
See something.

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,170
Write it out by hand so that you've

160
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,390
got the muscle memory, repeating it back
to yourself.

161
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,770
See it, say it, spell it, whatever.

162
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,690
As many input modes, you've got your
auditory learners, your visual learners.

163
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,760
You, you saturate yourself with learning
modes.

164
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,870
That's one of the reasons why people need
to be careful when you have a

165
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,070
faculty member or a teacher to put
something

166
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,620
on, on overheads or, or Powerpoints these
days.

167
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,330
And you just take their overheads and
don't really study them.

168
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,970
The, the mechanical act of writing helps
you to internalize that material, as

169
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,120
well as going back over the notes again,
helps you to internalize that material.

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,790
So, multi-mode input is critical for
learning.

171
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:13,320
again, with the study groups and
challenging each other, because

172
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,690
what you, what you think you know, you
find out

173
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,760
when you try to explain it to somebody
else, that's

174
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,970
why teaching is one of the best ways to
learn.

175
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,290
But even if you don't go full blown to
tutoring somebody else, just in discussing

176
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,870
it with a set of peers and colleagues,
okay, this is what I think I know.

177
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,220
And they challenge you.

178
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,536
Okay, well that's not what I thought I
thought, but let me explain.

179
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:37,490
And they will either, you will either
validate what you thought,

180
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,640
or you will find a, the fallacy in what
you thought.

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,670
And they do the same thing.

182
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,390
And so you help each other by explaining
material to each other.

183
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,045
If you just write it out, yeah I've got
it.

184
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,520
Well, you may not have it, or you may have
it wrong.

185
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,040
And so you have to take the time to

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,600
explain it, teach it, whatever, to
somebody else as a

187
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,310
way to make sure that you, in fact, have

188
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,710
what you think you have in terms of your
learning.

189
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,350
>> I think active learning like this,
really

190
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,790
grappling with it and using information
that's within

191
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,580
your own mind, that's the best way to know
you've really got it within your own mind.

192
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,110
>> Sure.

193
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,380
>> So, you're exactly right.

194
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,575
Norman, thank you so much.

195
