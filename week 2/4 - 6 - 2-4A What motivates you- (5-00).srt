00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,950
It is hard to learn when
you're not into it.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,460
But if it's something you're really
interested in, learning is easy.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,020
Why is that?

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,040
Most of the neurons in your cortex
carry information about what

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,059
is happening around you and
what you're doing.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,620
Your brain also has a set of diffusely
projecting systems of neuromodulators,

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,790
that carry information not about
the content of an experience but

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,940
it's importance and value to your future,
neuromodulators are chemicals that

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,410
influence how a neurons
responds to other neurons.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,780
And today we will discuss three of them.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,280
Acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,650
Acetylcholine neurons form
neuromodulatory connections to

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,670
the cortex that
are particularly important for

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,690
focused learning,
when you are paying close attention.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,690
These acetylcholine
neurons project widely and

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,810
activate circuits that
control synaptic plasticity.

18
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,100
Leading to new long term memory.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,960
Neuromodulators also have a profound
impact on your unconscious mind.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,280
One of the great brain discoveries
in my lifetime has been that our

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,450
motivation is controlled by a particular
chemical substance called Dopamine.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,660
Which is found in a small set of neurons
in our brain stem shown here in orange.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,690
These dopamine neurons are part of a large
brain system that controls reward learning

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,620
and in particular in the basal ganglia
which is located in the green region above

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,470
the dopamine neurons and
below the cortex at the top of the brain.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,270
Dopamine is released from these neurons,
when we receive an unexpected reward.

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,120
Dopamine signals project widely and
have a very powerful effect on learning.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,670
And this is something that
also affects decision making.

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,424
And even the value of sensory inputs.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,000
Dopamine is in the business of
predicting future rewards and

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,040
not just the immediate reward.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,150
This can motivate you to do something
that may not be rewarding right now but

33
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,580
will lead to a much better
reward in the future.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,480
Addictive drugs artificially
increase dopamine activity and

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,839
fool your brain into thinking that
something wonderful has just happened.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,970
In fact just the opposite
has just happened.

37
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,150
This leads to craving and dependence,
which can hijack your free will and

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,200
can motivate actions
that are harmful to you.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,290
Loss of Dopamine neurons leads
to a lack of motivation.

40
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,310
And something called anhedonia,

41
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,019
which is a loss of interest in
things that once gave you pleasure.

42
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,190
Severe loss of Dopamine
neurons causes resting tremor,

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,150
slowness, rigidity,
this is called Parkinson's disease.

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,250
Ultimately it leads to catatonia,
a complete lack of any movement.

45
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,460
Dopamine neurons are part of
the unconscience part of your brain.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,690
That you learned about in the first week.

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,580
When you promise to treat
yourself something after a study

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,560
section you are tapping
into your dopamine system.

49
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,930
Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system

50
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,980
that strongly affects your social life.

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,380
In monkey troops the alpha male has the
highest level of serotonin activity and

52
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,060
the lowest ranking male
has the lowest levels.

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,680
Prozac, which is prescribed for

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,100
clinical depression,
raises the level of Serotonin activity.

55
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,830
The level of Serotonin is also closely
linked to risk taking behavior.

56
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,880
With higher risk in
lower Serotonin monkeys.

57
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,840
Inmates in jail for

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,030
violent crimes have some of the lowest
levels of serotonin activity in society.

59
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,400
Finally your emotions strongly affect
learning as you are well aware.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,460
Emotions were once thought to
be separate from cognition but

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,420
recent research has shown that emotions
are intertwined with perception and

62
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,990
attention and
interact with learning and memory.

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,910
The amygdala an almond shaped structure
shown here, nestled down at the base of

64
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,950
the brain is one of the major
centers where cognition and

65
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,000
emotion are effectively integrated.

66
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,430
The amygdala is part of the limbic system
which together with hippocampus is

67
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,890
involved in processing memory and

68
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,690
decision making as well as
regulating emotional reactions.

69
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,970
You will want to keep your amygdala
happy to be an effective learner.

70
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,720
The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,050
action but are no less important for
successful learning.

72
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,290

Acetylcholine, Dopamine, and

Serotonin, look them on brainfacts.org.

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,970
Happy learning, until we meet again.
