1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,998
[SOUND] When you're learning a new idea,
for example a new vocabulary word.

2
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:13,243
Or a new concept or a new problem solving
approach.

3
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:18,690
You sometimes tend to practice it over and
over again during the same study session.

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,400
A little of this is useful and necessary,
but continuing to

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,580
study or practice after you've mastered
what you can in the session.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,120
Is called overlearning.

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,310
Overlearning can have its place, it can
help produce an automaticity that can be

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,920
important when you're executing a, a serve

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,870
in tennis, or playing a perfect piano
concerto.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,470
If you choke on tests or in

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,770
public speaking, overlearning can be
especially valuable.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,300
Did you know that even expert public
speakers practice on the

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,150
order of 70 hours for a typical 20 minute
TED Talk?

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,690
Automaticity can indeed be helpful in
times of nervousness.

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,510
But be wary of repetitive over-learning
during a single session.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,530
Research has shown it can be a waste of
valuable learning time.

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,400
The reality is, once you've got the basic
idea

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,540
down during a session, continuing to
hammer away at

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,260
it during the same session doesn't
strengthen the kinds

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,960
of long term memory connections you want
to have strengthened.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,280
Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a
little

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,170
like learning carpentry by only practicing
with a hammer.

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,740
After a while, you think you can fix
anything by just bashing at it.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,780
Using a subsequent study session to repeat
what you're

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,990
trying to learn is just fine, and often
valuable.

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,290
It can strengthen and deepen your chunked
neural patterns.

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,430
But be wary.

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,390
Repeating something you already know
perfectly well is, face it, easy.

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,140
It can also bring the illusion of
competence that you've mastered the

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,010
full range of material, when you've
actually only mastered the easy stuff.

31
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,850
Instead, you want to balance your studies
by

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,560
deliberately focusing on what you find
more difficult.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,480
This focusing on the more difficult
material is called deliberate practice.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,490
It's often what makes the difference
between

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,700
a good student and a great student.

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,465
All of this is also related to a concept
known as, Einstellung.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,790
In this phenomenon, your initial simple
thought, an

38
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,020
idea you already have in mind or a

39
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,550
neural pattern you've already developed
and strengthened, may

40
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,100
prevent a better idea or solution from
being found.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,570
We saw this in the focus pinball picture,
where your initial pinball thought went to

42
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,920
the upper part of the brain, but the

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,030
solution thought pattern was in the lower
part.

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,450
The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and

45
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,570
the previous patterns you built can create
a sort

46
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,910
of rut, that prevents you from springing
to

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,390
a new place where the solution might be
found.

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,440
Incidentally, the German word, Einstellung
means installation.

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,880
Basically you can remember einstellung as
installing a roadblock

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,530
because of the way you were initially
looking at something.

51
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,410
This kind of wrong approach is especially
easy to

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,960
do in sports and science, not to mention
other disciplines.

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,350
Because sometimes your initial intuition
about what's happening

54
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,210
or what you need to be doing is
misleading.

55
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,570
You have to unlearn your erroneous older
ideas

56
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,100
or approaches even while you're learning
new ones.

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,560
One significant mistake students sometimes
make in learning is

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,620
jumping into the water before they learn
to swim.

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,320
In other words they blindly start working
on homework without reading the

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,870
textbook, attending lectures, viewing
online lessons,

61
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,070
or, or even speaking with someone
knowledgeable.

62
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,320
This is a recipe for sinking, it's like

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,520
randomly allowing a thought to kind of pop
off

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,920
in the focused mode pinball machine, without
paying

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,740
any real attention to where the solution
truly lies.

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,580
Understanding how to obtain real solutions
is important in learning and in life.

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,150
Mastering a new subject means learning not
only the basic

68
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,650
chunks, but also learning how to select
and use different chunks.

69
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,199
The best way to learn that is by
practicing jumping back and forth [SOUND]

70
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,824
between problems or situations that
require different

71
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:35,234
techniques or strategies, this is called,
[SOUND] interleaving.

72
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,199
Once you have the basic idea of a
technique down

73
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,923
during your study session sort of like,
learning to ride a

74
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:46,864
bike with training wheels, start
interleaving your practice with problems

75
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:52,208
of different types or different types of
approaches, concepts, or procedures.

76
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,630
Sometimes this can be a little tough to
do.

77
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,030
A given section in a book for example is
often devoted to a specific technique so

78
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,950
when you flip to that section, you already

79
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,850
know which technique you're going to be
using.

80
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,170
Still, do what you can to mix up your
learning.

81
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,650
In science and math in particular it can
help to look ahead at

82
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,360
the more varied problem sets that are
sometimes found at the end of chapters.

83
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,290
Or you can deliberately try to make
yourself occasionally pick out

84
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,010
why some problems call for one technique
as opposed to another.

85
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,230
You want your brain to become used to the
idea that just

86
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,450
knowing how to use a particular

87
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,330
concept, approach, or problem-solving
technique isn't enough.

88
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,720
You also need to know when to use it.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,340
Interleaving your studies, making it a
point to review for a

90
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,990
test for example, by skipping around
through problems in the different

91
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,110
chapters and materials, can sometimes seem
to make your learning a

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,110
little more difficult, but in reality it
helps you learn more deeply.

93
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,550
Interleaving is extraordinarily important.

94
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,500
Although practice and repetition is
important in helping build solid neural

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,110
patterns to draw on, it's interleaving

96
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,070
that starts building flexibility and
creativity.

97
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,690
It's where you leave the world of

98
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,388
practice and repetition and begin thinking
more independently.

99
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:23,260
When you interleave within one subject or
one discipline,

100
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,326
you begin to develop your creative power
within that discipline.

101
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:30,640
When you interleave between several
subjects or

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,890
disciplines, you can easily, more easily
make interesting

103
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,900
new connections between chunks in the
different

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,590
fields, which can enhance your creativity
even further.

105
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,100
Of course it takes time to develop solid
chunks

106
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,060
of knowledge in different fields so
sometimes there's a tradeoff.

107
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,260
Developing expertise in several fields
means you can bring

108
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,760
very new ideas from one field to the
other.

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,220
But it can also mean that your expertise
in one field or the other,

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,690
isn't quite as deep as that of the person
who specializes in only one discipline.

111
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,350
On the other hand, if you develop
expertise in

112
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,720
only one discipline, you may know it very
deeply, but

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,810
you may become more deeply entrenched in
your familiar ways

114
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,030
of thinking, and not be able to handle new
ideas.

115
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,710
Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn
discovered that

116
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,330
most paradigm shifts in science are
brought

117
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,090
about by either young people, or people

118
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,000
who were originally trained in a different
discipline.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,450
They are not so easily trapped by
einstellung.

120
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,500
Blocked thoughts due to their preceding
training.

121
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,770
And of course there is the old saying that
science progresses one funeral at

122
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,330
a time, as people entrenched in the old
ways of looking at things die off.

123
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,210
Finally don't make the mistake of thinking
that learning only occurs

124
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,030
in the kinds of subjects you acquire from
teachers or books.

125
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,600
When you teach a child how to deal
effectively with a bully, or you fix a

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,910
leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small
suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong.

127
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,758
All of these illustrate the outcomes of
important aspects of learning.

128
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,980
Physicist Richard Feynman was inspired in
his nobel prize winning work by

129
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,910
watching someone throw a dinner plate into
the air in a cafeteria.

130
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,500
And Mike Rowe of the television show Dirty
Jobs and Somebody's Gotta Do It, shows how

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,730
important and exciting learning can be in
a variety of non-academic disciplines.

132
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,779
I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning
about learning.

133
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,099
