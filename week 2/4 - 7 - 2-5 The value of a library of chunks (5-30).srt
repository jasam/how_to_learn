00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,592
[SOUND] The ability to combine chunks in
new and original

2
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:14,347
ways underlies a lot of historical
innovation.

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,612
Bill Gates and other industry leaders set
aside extended week-long reading

4
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:25,530
periods so that they can hold many and
varied ideas in mind during one time.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,400
This helps generate their own innovative
thinking by allowing fresh

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,350
in mind not yet forgotten ideas to network
amongst themselves.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,700
Basically what people do to enhance their
knowledge and gain expertise

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,490
is to gradually build the number of chunks
in their mind.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,805
Valuable bits of information, they can
piece together in new and creative ways.

10
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,060
Chess masters, for example, can easily

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,340
access thousands of different chess
patterns.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,140
Musicians, linguists and scientists can
each access

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,660
similar chunks of knowledge in their own
disciplines.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,980
The bigger and more well practiced your

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,200
chunked mental library, whatever the
subject you're

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,610
learning, the more easily you'll be able

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,340
to solve problems and figure out
solutions.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,090
As we'll discover soon, chunking isn't all
you'll

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,170
need to develop creative flexibility in
your learning.

20
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,720
But it's an important component.

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,100
Chunks can also help you understand new
concepts.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,900
This is because when you grasp one chunk,
you'll find that that chunk can be related

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,150
in surprising ways to similar chunks, not
only

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,810
in that field, but also in very different
fields.

25
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,120
This idea is called transfer.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,920
For example, concepts and problems solving
methods you learned for

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,960
physics can be very similar to chunked
concepts in business.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,400
I've found some aspects of language
learning were very helpful

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,630
for me when I later began to learn
computer programming.

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,010
A chunk is a way of compressing
information much more compactly.

31
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,745
As you gain more experience in chunking in
any particular subject,

32
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:09,226
you'll see that the chunks you're able to
create are bigger.

33
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:13,039
In some sense that the ribbons are longer.

34
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,810
Not only are those ribbons longer, but the
neural patterns are in some sense darker.

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,910
They're, they're more solid and firmly
ingrained.

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,540
If you have a library of

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,090
concepts and solutions internalized as
chunked patterns,

38
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,390
you can think of it as a collection or a
library of neural patterns.

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,330
When you're trying to figure something
out, if

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,100
you have a good library of these chunks,
you

41
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
can more easily skip to the right solution
by

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,130
metaphorically speaking, listening to
whispers from your diffuse mode.

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,190
Your diffuse mode can help you connect two
or

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,880
more chunks together in new ways to solve
novel problems.

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,320
Another way to think of it is this.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,810
As you build each chunk, it is filling in
a part of your larger knowledge picture.

47
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,440
But if you don't practice with your
growing chunks, they can remain faint, and

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,980
it's harder to put together the big
picture of what you're trying to learn.

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,260
In building a chunked library, you're
training your brain

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,090
to recognize not only a specific concept,
but different types

51
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,350
and classes of concepts so that you can
automatically

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,440
know how to solve quickly or handle
whatever you encounter.

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,790
You'll start to see patterns that simplify
problem solving for you and will

54
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,570
soon find that different solution
techniques are

55
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,050
lurking at the edge of your memory.

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,100
Before midterms or finals it can be easy
to

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,180
brush up and have these solutions at the
mental ready.

58
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,780
There are two ways to figure something out
or to solve problems.

59
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,510
First there's sequential step by step
reasoning,

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,660
and second through a more holistic
intuition.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,050
Sequential thinking, where each small step
leads

62
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,270
deliberately towards a solution, involves
the focused mode.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,560
Intuition on the other hand often seems to
require this

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,150
creative diffuse mode linking of several
seemingly different focused mode thoughts.

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,350
Most difficult problems and concepts are
grasped through intuition, because these

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,570
new ideas make a leap away from what
you're familiar with.

67
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,030
Keep in mind that the diffuse mode's semi
random way of making connections means

68
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,980
that the solutions they provide should be

69
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,900
very carefully verified using the focused
mode.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,140
Intuitive insights aren't always correct.

71
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,290
You may think there are so many problems
and concepts, just in a single

72
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,460
section or chapter of whatever you're
studying,

73
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,840
there's just no way to learn them all.

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,940
This is where the law of serendipity comes
into play.

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,510
Lady luck favors the one who tries.

76
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,830
Just focus on whatever section you're
studying.

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,290
You'll find that once you put that first
problem or concept in your mental library,

78
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,790
whatever it is, then the second concept
will go in a little more easily.

79
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,330
And the third more easily still.

80
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,060
Not that all of this is a snap, but it
does get easier.

81
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,380
I am Barbara Oakley.

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,765
Thanks for learning about learning.
