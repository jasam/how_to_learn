00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,017
[SOUND] In this video I'm going to walk
you through

2
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:11,303
the basic steps behind how to make a
chunk.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,700
Every discipline is a little different.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,210
Chunking in the subject of history, for
example, is

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,070
quite different from chunking in chemistry
or in karate.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,129
In my explanations here, I'm going to lean
a little more

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:28,520
towards explaining chunking of mental
ideas rather than physical body motions.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,840
But you'll see that the two approaches are
closely related.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,120
So, whether you're learning something
mental or

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,240
something physical, you'll find some
helpful ideas here.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,610
The first step on chunking is simply to
focus

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,880
your undivided attention on the
information you want to chunk.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,040
If you had the television going on in the
background, or you're

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,420
looking up every few minutes to check or
answer your phone or computer

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,180
messages, it means you're going to have
more difficulty in making a

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,230
chunk, because your brain is not really
focusing on chunking the new material.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,612
When you first begin to learn something,
you're making new neural patterns and

18
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,449
connecting them with preexisting patterns
that are

19
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,650
spread through many areas of the brain.

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,036
Your octopus tentacles, so to speak, can't
reach very well if some of them are

21
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:24,740
off on other thoughts using up some of the
limited slots in your working memory.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,770
The second step in chunking is to
understand the basic idea you're trying to

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,810
chunk, whether it's understanding a
concept such

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,220
as continental drift, seeing the
connection between

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,420
the basic elements of the plot for a
story, grasping the economic principle of

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,920
supply and demand, or comprehending the
essence

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,810
of a particular type of math problem.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,790
Students can often synthesize the gist,
that is

29
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,210
figure out the main idea or ideas, pretty
naturally.

30
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,390
Or at least they can grasp those ideas if
they allow the focused and

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,260
diffuse modes of thinking to take turns in
helping them figure out what's going on.

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Understanding is like a superglue that

33
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,380
helps hold the underlying memory traces
together.

34
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,120
It creates broad encompassing traces that
can link to other memory traces.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,990
Can you create a chunk if you don't
understand?

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,300
Yes, but it's often a useless chunk that
won't fit

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,520
in with, or relate to other material of
your learning.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,510
That said, it's important to realize that

39
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,230
just understanding how a problem was
solved, for

40
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,640
example, does not necessarily create a
chunk

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,430
that you can easily call to mind later.

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,300
Don't confuse the "Aha!", of a breakthrough in
understanding, with solid expertise.

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,880
That's part of why you can grasp an idea
when

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,570
a teacher presents it in class, but if you
don't review

45
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,470
it fairly soon after you first learned it,
it can

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,230
seem incomprehensible when it comes time
to prepare for a test.

47
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,661
In math and science related subjects,
closing the

48
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:10,118
book and testing yourself on whether you,
yourself,

49
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:13,198
can solve the problem you think you
understand,

50
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,922
will speed up your learning at this stage.

51
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:19,621
You often realize the first time you
actually understand

52
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,947
something is when you can actually do it
yourself.

53
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:26,596
It's the same in many disciplines, just
looking at someone

54
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:30,962
else's painting doesn't mean you could
actually create that painting

55
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:34,179
yourself, and just hearing a song won't
give you the

56
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,779
expertise you need to sing it in the same
resonant fashion.

57
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:43,646
>> [MUSIC]

58
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:46,271
>> Just because you see it or even that
you

59
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:51,100
understand it, it doesn't mean that you
can actually do it.

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,440
Only doing it yourself helps create

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,480
the neural patterns that underlie true
mastery.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,370
The third step to chunking is gaining
context, so you can

63
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,670
see not just how, but also when to use
this chunk.

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,930
Context means going beyond the initial
problem and seeing

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,990
more broadly, repeating and practicing
with both related and unrelated

66
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,460
problems, so that you can see not only
when

67
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,920
to use the chunk, but when not to use it.

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,598
This helps you see how your newly formed
chunk fits into the bigger picture.

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,619
In other words, you may have a tool

70
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:30,548
in your strategy or problem solving tool
box, but

71
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:35,030
if you don't know when to use that tool,
it's not going to do you a lot of good.

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Ultimately, practice helps you broaden the
networks of neurons that are connected to

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,040
your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm,

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,080
but also accessible from many different
paths.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,050
As you can see from this top down,

76
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,820
bottom up illustration, learning takes
place in two ways.

77
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,200
There's a bottom up chunking process,
where

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,260
practice and repetition can help you both
build

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,630
and strengthen each chunk, so you can
easily access it whenever you need to.

80
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,870
And there's also a, a sort of a top down
big picture process

81
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,280
that allows you to see what you're
learning and where it fits in.

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,050
Both processes are vital in gaining
mastery over the material.

83
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,540
Context is where bottom up and top down
learning meet.

84
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,180
To clarify here, chunking may involve your

85
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,600
learning how to use a certain
problem-solving technique.

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,770
Context means learning when to use that
technique instead of some other technique.

87
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,680
Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk
through a

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,720
chapter in a book before you begin
studying it,

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,170
glancing at pictures and section headings,
can allow

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,020
you to gain a sense of the big picture.

91
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,030
So can listening to a very well organized
lecture.

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,990
These kinds of activities can help you
know where

93
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,300
to put the chunks you're constructing, how
the chunks

94
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,360
relate to one another, just as you see
here,

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
with the image of the man in the car.

96
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,210
Learn the major concepts or points first.

97
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,330
These are often the key parts of a good
instructor

98
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,630
or book chapter's outline, flow charts,
tables, or concept maps.

99
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,460
Once you have this done, fill in the
details.

100
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,960
Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are
missing at

101
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,740
the end of your studies, you can still see
the big picture.

102
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,920
So there you go.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,800
Summing it up, chunks are best built

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,280
with focused attention, understanding of
the basic idea,

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,510
and practice to help you gain mastery and
a sense of the big picture context.

106
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,095
Those are the essential steps in making a
chunk and fitting

107
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:57,370
that chunk into a greater conceptual
overview of what you're learning.

108
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,210
But there's more.

109
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,290
I'm Barbara Oakley.

110
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,020
Thanks for learning how to learn.
