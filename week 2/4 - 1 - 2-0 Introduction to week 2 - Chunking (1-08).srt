[SOUND].

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:07,213
This week, we're going to be talking about
chunks, compact

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:11,320
packages of information that your mind can
easily access.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,250
We'll talk about how you can form chunks,
how you can use them to improve your

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,750
understanding of, and creativity with the
material, and

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,340
how chunks can help you do better on
tests.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,510
We'll also talk about illusions of
competence in learning.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,010
This was when you're using ineffective
study methods that fool your mind

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,410
into thinking you're learning something
when you're mostly just wasting your time.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,800
We'll cover what those less effective
study methods are and tell you what

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
methods research has shown will work
better to help you in your studies.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,240
Finally we'll talk about something called
overlearning, which

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,450
can solidly ingrain information in your
mind, but also

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,570
can be a little like digging deeper ruts

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,850
as you might spin your wheels
ineffectively in learning.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,040
You can make your study time more valuable

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,610
by interleaving, providing intelligent
variety in your studies.

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,070
I'm Barbara Oakley.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,870
Thanks for learning how to learn.
