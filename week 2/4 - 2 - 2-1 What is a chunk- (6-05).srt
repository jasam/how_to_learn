1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,695
[SOUND] In this video, we're going to
answer the question.

2
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:09,650
What is a chunk?

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,660
When you first look at a brand new concept
it sometimes

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,130
doesn't make much sense, as shown by the
jumbled puzzle pieces here.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,850
Chunking is the mental leap that helps

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,810
you unite bits of information together
through meaning.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,890
The new logical whole makes the chunk
easier to remember, and also makes

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,500
it easier to fit the chunk into the larger
picture of what you're learning.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,650
Just memorizing a fact without
understanding

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,700
or context doesn't help you understand
what's

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,820
really going on or how the concept

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,140
fits together with other concepts you're
learning.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,430
Notice there are no interlocking puzzle
edges on the

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,430
puzzle piece to help you fit it to other
pieces.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,790
We talked earlier about working memory and
how

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,510
those four slots of working memory appear
to

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,660
hang out in the part of your brain

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,390
right behind your forehead known as the
prefrontal cortex.

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,370
When you're focusing your attention on
something

20
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,110
it's almost as if you have an octopus.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,740
The octopus of attention that slips it's
tentacles

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,740
through those four slots of working memory
when necessary

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,260
to help you make connections to
information that

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,760
you might have in various parts of your
brain.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,240
Remember, this is different from the
random connections of the diffuse mode.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,230
Focusing your attention to connect parts
of the brain to tie

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,370
together ideas is an important part of the
focused mode of learning.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,950
It is also often what helps get you
started in creating a chunk.

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,150
Interestingly when you're stressed your
attentional octopus begins to

30
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,210
lose the ability to make some of those
connections.

31
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,190
This is why your brain doesn't seem to

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,100
work right when you're angry, stressed, or
afraid.

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,780
Chunks are pieces of information,
neuroscientifically speaking,

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,820
through bound together through meaning or
use.

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,590
You can take the letters P-O and P and
bind them

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,870
together into one conceptual easy to
remember chunk, the word pop.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,059
[SOUND] It's like converting a, a
cumbersome computer file into a ZIP file.

38
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:33,413
Underneath that single pop chunk is a
symphony of neurons

39
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:37,323
that have learned to sing in tune with one
another.

40
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,237
The complex neural activity that ties

41
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:44,990
together our simplifying abstract chunks
of thought.

42
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,790
Whether those thoughts pertain to
acronyms, ideas, or concepts are

43
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,610
the basis of much of the science,
literature, and art.

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,210
Let's say you want to learn how to speak
Spanish.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,510
If you're a child hanging around a Spanish

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,830
speaking household, learning Spanish is as
natural as breathing.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,450
Your mother says, mama.

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,920
And you say, mama, right back to her.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,120
Your neurons fire and wire together in a
shimmering mental loop cementing

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,600
the relationship in your mind between the
sound mama and your mother's smiling face.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,250
That scintillating neural loop is one
memory trace, which

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,680
is connected of course to many other
related memory traces.

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,410
The best programs for learning language,
such as those of

54
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,400
the Defense Language Institute where I
learned Russian, incorporate structured

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,780
practice that includes repetition and rote
focus mode learning of

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,740
the language along with more diffuse-like
free speech with native speakers.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,350
The goal is to embed the basic words and
patterns so you can speak

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,770
as freely and creatively in your new

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,360
language as you do in your native
language.

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,980
As it turns out one of the

61
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,430
first steps towards gaining expertise in
academic topics

62
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,410
is to create conceptual chunks, mental
leaps

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,920
that unite scattered bits of information
through meaning.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,520
The concept of neural chunks also applies
to sports, music,

65
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,330
dance, really just about anything that
humans can get good at.

66
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,960
Basically, a chunk means a network of
neurons that are used to firing together

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,090
so you can think a thought or perform an
action smoothly and effectively.

68
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,810
Focused practice and repetition, the
creation of

69
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,630
strong memory traces, helps you to create
chunks.

70
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,280
The path to expertise is built little by

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,210
little, small chunks can become larger,
and all of

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,760
the expertise serves to underpin more
creative interpretations

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,930
as you gradually become a master of the
material.

74
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,270
In other words, as you'll see later,

75
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,200
practice and repetition in building chunks
aren't

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,340
all you need to become a truly creative
master of the material you're learning.

77
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,010
Chunking helps your brain run more
efficiently.

78
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,050
Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an
action,

79
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,170
you don't know need to remember all the
little underlying details.

80
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,390
You've got the main idea, the chunk, and
that's enough.

81
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,870
It's like getting dressed in the morning.

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,420
You just think one simple thought like,
I'll

83
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,730
get dressed, but it's amazing when you
realize

84
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,460
the complex swirl of underlying activities
that take

85
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,580
place with that one, simple chunk of
thought.

86
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,750
Next, we'll talk about how you can form a
chunk.

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm Barbara Oakley.

88
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,358
Thanks for learning how to learn.
