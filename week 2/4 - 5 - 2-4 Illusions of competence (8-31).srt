[SOUND].

2
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:11,795
In this video, we're going to talk about

3
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,930
some essential ideas in getting your
learning on track.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,655
The importance of recall, illusions of
competence in learning.

5
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:24,350
Mini-testing and the value of making
mistakes.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,860
One of the most common approaches for
trying to learn material

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,270
from a book or from notes is simply to
reread it.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,750
But psychologist, Jeffrey Karpicke, has
shown that this approach

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,250
is actually much less productive than
another, very simple, technique.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,740
Recall.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,710
After you've read the material, simply
look away, and see

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,380
what you can recall from the material
you've just read.

13
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,290
Karpicke's research, published in the
Journal

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,610
Science, provided solid evidence along
these lines.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,290
Students studied a scientific text and
then practiced it,

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,348
by recalling as much of the information as
they could.

17
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:06,320
Then they re-studied the text and recalled
it again.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,460
That is, they tried to remember the key
ideas, once more.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,540
The results, in the same amount of time,

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,090
by simply practising and recalling the
material students

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,910
learned far more and at a much deeper

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,290
level than they did using any other
approach.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,090
Including simply rereading the text a
number of times.

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,510
Or drawing concept maps that supposedly
enrich

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,070
the relationships in the materials under
study.

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,170
This improved learning comes whether
students take

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,740
a formal test, or just informally test
themselves.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,130
This gives an important reminder.

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,300
When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just
being mindless robots.

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,090
The retrieval process itself enhances deep
learning,

31
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,200
and helps us to begin forming chunks.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,900
It's almost as if the recall process helps
build in

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,530
little neural hooks, that we can hang our
thinking on.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,980
Even more of a surprise to researchers,
was that the students themselves predicted

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,270
that simply reading and recalling the
materials, wasn't the best way to learn.

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,210
They thought, concept mapping, drawing
diagrams that show

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,270
the relationship between the concepts
would be the best.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,940
But if you're trying to build connections
between chunks, before the

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,410
basic chunks are embedded in the brain, it
doesn't work as well.

40
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,070
It's like trying to learn advanced
strategy in chess, before

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,900
you even understand the basic concepts of
how the pieces move.

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,820
Using recall, mental retrieval of the key
ideas, rather than

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,450
passive rereading, will make your study
time more focused and effective.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,750
The only time rereading text seems to be
effective, is if you let time pass

45
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,780
between the rereading, so that it becomes
more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

46
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,010
One way to think about this type of
learning and recall, is shown right here.

47
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,440
As we mentioned earlier, there are four or so
slots, in working memory.

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,640
When you're first learning how to
understand a concept, or technique to

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,400
solve a problem, your entire working
memory is involved in the process.

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,520
As shown by this sort of, mad tangle

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,220
of connections between the four slots of
working memory.

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,040
As you begin to chunk the concept, you
will

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,530
feel it connecting more easily and
smoothly in your mind.

54
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,750
Once the concept is chunked, it takes up
only one slot in working memory.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,380
It simultaneously becomes one smooth
strand that's easy

56
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,050
to follow, and to use to make new
connections.

57
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,710
The rest of your working memory is left
clear.

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,610
That dangling strand of chunked material
has, in some sense,

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,290
increased the amount of information
available to your working memory.

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,260
It's as if the slot in working memory is a

61
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,599
hyperlink that's been connected to a great
big web page.

62
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,050
Now, you understand, why it is key that
you are

63
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,630
the one doing the problem solving or
mastering the concept.

64
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,110
Not whoever wrote the solution manual, or
book, on whatever subject you're studying.

65
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,840
If you just look at the solution, for
example, then tell yourself.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh yeah, I see why they did that.

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,770
Then the solution is not really yours.

68
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,030
You've done almost nothing to knit those

69
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,140
concepts into your own underlying neural
circuitry.

70
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,750
Merely glancing at a solution and thinking
you truly know it

71
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,100
yourself is one of the most common
illusions of competence in learning.

72
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,570
You must have the information persisting
in your memory if you're to

73
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,990
master the material well enough to do well
on tests and to think creatively with it.

74
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,510
In a related thing, you may be surprised
to

75
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,480
learn that highlighting and underlining
must be done very carefully.

76
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,370
Otherwise it can not only be ineffective,
but also misleading.

77
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,230
It's as if, making lots of motions with
your hand can

78
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,110
fool you into thinking you've placed the
concept in your brain.

79
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,170
If you do mark up the text, try to look
for main ideas before making any marks.

80
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,330
And try to keep your underlining or
highlighting to a minimum.

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,330
One sentence or less per paragraph.

82
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,730
On the other hand, words or notes in a

83
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,740
margin that synthesize key concepts are a
very good idea.

84
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,190
Jeff Karpicke, the same researcher who's
done such important work

85
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,160
related to recall, has also done research
on a related topic.

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,510
Illusions of competence in learning.

87
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,410
The reason students like to keep rereading
their notes

88
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,970
or a textbook, is that when they have the
book

89
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,250
or Google open right in front of them, it
provides

90
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,710
the illusion that the material is also in
their brains.

91
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,075
But it's not, because it can be easier to
look at the book instead of

92
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,906
recalling, students persist in their
illusions studying

93
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:22,600
in a way that just isn't very effective.

94
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,350
This is a reminder that just wanting to
learn the material, and

95
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,960
spending a lot of time with it, doesn't
guarantee you'll actually learn it.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,260
A super helpful way to make sure you're
learning and not fooling

97
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,780
yourself with illusions of competence, is

98
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,480
to test yourself on whatever you're
learning.

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,790
In some sense, that's what recall is
actually doing.

100
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,910
Allowing you to see whether or not you
really grasp an idea.

101
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,720
If you make a mistake in what you are
doing, it's actually a very good thing.

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,250
You want to try not to repeat your
mistakes, of course, but mistakes are

103
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,980
very valuable to make in your little self
tests before high stakes real tests.

104
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,130
Because they allow you to make repairs and
you're thinking flaws bit by bit

105
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,500
mistakes help correct your thinking, so
that you can learn better and do better.

106
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,980
As you know now recall is a powerful tool.

107
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,090
But here's another tip, recalling material
when you are outside your usual

108
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,866
place of study can also help you
strengthen your grasp of the material.

109
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,430
You don't realize it, but when you are
learning

110
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,670
something new you can often take in
subliminal cues

111
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,010
for the room and the space around you

112
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,210
at the time you were originally learning
the material.

113
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,560
This can throw you off when you take tests
because you often take

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,410
tests in a room that's different from the
room you were learning in.

115
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,450
By recalling and thinking about the
material when you are in various physical

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,210
environment, you become independent of the
cues from any one given location.

117
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,670
That helps you avoid the problem of the
test

118
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,970
room being different from where you
originally learned the material.

119
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,652
I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning
about learning.
