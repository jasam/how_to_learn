1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:05,496
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:08,620
Well let me ask you this, now.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,950
When you, yourself are faced with a new
concept or you're trying to figure

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,290
out something brand new and it's
difficult, what advice would you have

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,430
in general for learners to be able to, to
grapple with

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,530
and assimilate these new ideas or solve a
new area that they're first facing?

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,230
>> Well, just like with the test question
that we talked about, I think

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,680
there are a lot of different ways to
approach a difficult task.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,580
And in fact as we were thinking about
talking about this

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,410
issue Rich and I realized that we, we
approach things differently.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,770
My I'm a rather big picture person.

12
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,320
More of a global kind of learner.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,672
And so, often when I'm looking at some
difficult material

14
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:10,460
I'll take time if I have some thing a
chapter, or

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,560
some sort of text, I'll look through it, I'll
just skim through.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,590
I read a little at the end, I will pick up

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,790
a piece here and there and then begin to
dig in a

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,170
little bit deeper, but I do better when I
sort of have

19
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,110
a general sense of what it is I'm supposed
to be learning.

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,520
I might skip to the back and look at what
kind

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,420
of problems am I supposed to be able to
solve with this.

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,510
And so when you're working in disciplines
where problem solving is an important

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:47,660
part that can be a way to get into it, to
begin to make sense of it.

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,120
>> And the way that I differ from Rebecca
is I'm a strongly sequential learner.

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,839
And so I take the first step, then the
next step, then the next step.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,390
But, again, I never learned anything
passively.

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,290
Anything non-trivial.

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,690
If it's just a simple fact of definition
of a

29
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,780
term I can read it and memorize it, but if
it's

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,340
really conceptually difficult, whether
it's

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,550
a part of a problem-solving procedure,

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,180
a derivation that I'm trying to work
through or anything else.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,740
The only way I learn anything is by doing
it.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,180
So, I'll read this and then I'll try to
explain it to myself.

35
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,940
or, what I, when I've learned things best
of

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,460
anything at all is when I've had to teach.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,820
And I think practically every teacher will
tell you the same thing.

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,030
You know, I thought I knew this stuff.

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,600
I got As in all those courses back in
college.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,730
But it wasn't until I had to explain it to
these students that I was teaching that

41
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,820
I found out that I really didn't
understand

42
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,880
it at the level that I thought I did.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,170
And so I try to find examples.

44
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,390
I try to find clear ways of explaining
difficult concepts.

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,340
And in the course of doing that that's
when the real understanding came,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,960
and so this is another strong argument,
among other things, for working in groups.

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,030
If you can if you're working with other
people

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,410
and together you're trying to figure
something out and

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,100
you get a certain point and then you try

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,070
to explain it to the others you're
reinforcing your understanding.

51
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,450
And they may or not, may not understand it
after your

52
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,570
finished figuring out how to explain it,
but boy do you.

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,660
And so those two pieces of advice.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,360
I learn by doing things, by trying them.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,670
If it's a mathematical method or procedure
or

56
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,780
something in physics or in engineering,
then I try

57
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,010
to work out the solution myself without
looking

58
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,500
back at the book, the text, whatever it
is.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,470
And when I can do it by myself without

60
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,500
referring back, then, obviously, I know
how to do it.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,190
And then to really reinforce that

62
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,250
understanding, explaining it to someone
else.

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,440
Put those two things together, and well,
at least that's how I learned it.

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,570
>> I think using your resources too.

65
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,180
Whatever those resources may be.

66
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,040
You've got text, you've got things online,
you

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,970
have people who really understand that
difficult thing

68
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,810
that you're trying to learn and, and so
make, not being afraid to just go out

69
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,260
ask questions work with all the resources
you

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,400
have to try to find what's going to work

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,570
for you to make it clear, to make you more
confident figure out what you're doing.

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,140
>> Oh, absolutely.

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,230
>> Playing, playing off of that, one of my
biggest

74
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,800
problems as a professor is getting
students to ask questions.

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,300
>> [LAUGH].

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,920
>> They don't want to do it.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,800
And it's not that, well some of us,
sometimes

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,020
they're so confused that they don't know
what to ask.

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,448
But much more often it's a matter of fear.

80
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:59,050
You know if I ask a question in class, it

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,690
could be seen by my classmates as a dumb
question.

82
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,280
And we as instructors can make all of the
pretty

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
speeches we want about how there are no
dumb questions.

84
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,370
All questions are good because they tea-,

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,045
forget that.

86
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,452
>> [SOUND].

87
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:11,830
>> Right?

88
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,750
I, the students are not buying that, and

89
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,055
besides, to be perfectly honest, there are
dumb questions.

90
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:21,240
>> [LAUGH]
>> And we've all heard them.

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,130
And so the student is reasoning, if I open
my mouth to ask a question, I

92
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,640
could be perceived as dumb by my
colleagues, my classmates, my professor.

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,550
If I keep my mouth shut I'm risking
nothing and so they don't

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,870
ask, and I also can't persuade most of them
to come to my office.

95
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,710
I have office hours every week, in which I
tell the students, I'm there for you.

96
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,760
I promise I will be there.

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,570
I will be welcoming of any questions that
you ask.

98
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,540
I'll find out where you're getting stuck
and you won't

99
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,880
leave my office until you have the answer
to that question.

100
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,810
Maybe for the same fear they don't want to
come.

101
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,500
And so, they're not taking advantage of

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,300
the resources that Rebecca was referring
to.

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,700
And if a student can be persuaded to
overcome that fear

104
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,350
and just ask either in class or in the
office in five

105
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,140
minutes they can get things cleared up
that they could spend

106
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,150
three hours at home banging their heads
against and not getting clear.

107
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,860
Let me go back to a couple of points I
made before.

108
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,910
The best way to get the illusion of
competence

109
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,970
when you don't really understand something
is to listen

110
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,010
to a lecture or to read a text, like

111
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,280
a novel, or to read over old homework
solutions.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,350
And imagine that you understand them.

113
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,300
Because you don't.

114
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,120
The best way to get over the illusion of
competence is to do it.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,130
Solve the problem, again, without looking
back at the old solution.

116
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,690
Work out the derivation one step at a

117
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,350
time without looking back at the textbook
or your

118
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,780
lecture notes or whatever it is, and when

119
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,660
you can do it by yourself without any
reference.

120
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,610
When you can reproduce that solution
entirely by yourself then it's not

121
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,890
an illusion of competence, clearly you can
do it because you did it,

122
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,800
but it's not until you do it, actually
unaided, that you can

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,940
rest that, okay, I'm ready for the test or
whatever it may be.

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,080
>> This can also be a good time for
working with your peers.

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:38,260
Taking turns, explaining, a work, perhaps
a worked out example in the text.

126
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,170
Explaining it step by step to each other.

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,100
When you start trying to verbalize it then
you begin to see, wait a minute, I, I,

128
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,490
I thought I knew how they made that step,
but when I try to explain it, I, I don't.

129
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,170
So what, what's going on?

130
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,900
Let's look at it.

131
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,380
So I think that working with other people
can really help you in that way too.

132
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,550
So one of the things that you can do to
make sure

133
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,110
you are thinking about all the different
aspects of the

134
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,500
subject that, that you're trying to
understand and it's to set it up.

135
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,580
Look at a complex system that might be
used in a problem in your text.

136
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,950
And then just think about, what are about all
the things

137
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,290
that the teacher might ask me to do with
this system.

138
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,930
And in working through that you begin to
think about

139
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,670
all of the elements that need to be in
place.

140
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,230
So that's a great way to study for a test.

141
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,810
It's also a great way to sort of get past
that illusion

142
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,010
of competence because as you're looking at
it and as you're working through

143
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,160
the example and what you think you might
be asked you'll uncover

144
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,475
some things that maybe you don't know as
well as you thought you did.
