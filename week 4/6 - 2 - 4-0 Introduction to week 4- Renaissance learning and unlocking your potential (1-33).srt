00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,928
This week we are going to wrap up a slew

3
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:09,776
of important ideas, and techniques that
will help round out and

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:13,980
enhance your ability to learn well, using
metaphors and analogies,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,000
to work profitable with teammates, and not
undercut your own strengths.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,270
And finally to perform well on tests.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,020
One important thought though, before we
launch into this week's videos.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,000
Learning doesn't progress logically, so
that each day just

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,820
adds an additional neat package to your
knowledge shelf.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,360
Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing
your understanding.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,030
Things that made sense before can suddenly
seem confusing.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,330
This type of knowledge collapse seems to
occur when your

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,830
mind is restructuring its understanding,
building a more solid foundation.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,430
In the case of language learners, they
experience occasional

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,790
periods when the foreign language suddenly
seems completely incomprehensible.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,910
Remember it takes time to assimilate new
knowledge.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,870
You'll inevitably go through some periods
when you seem

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,330
to take and exasperating step backwards, in
your understanding.

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,060
This is a natural phenomenon, that means
that

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,900
your mind is wrestling deeply with the
material.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,000
You'll find that when you emerge from
these periods of

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,320
temporary frustration, your knowledge base
will take a surprising leap forward.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning
how to learn.
