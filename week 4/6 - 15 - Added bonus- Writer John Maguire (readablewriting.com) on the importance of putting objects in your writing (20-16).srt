1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,240
John G Maguire comes from a family
of news reporters and writers.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,940
His father, the late, John Maguire, wrote
for the Albany, New York Times Union.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,340
His brother, Gregory Maguire is
a novelist whose work includes the book,

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,700
Wicked, from which a hit
musical has been made.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,250
John Maguire has been
a professional writer all his life.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,780
He began in college as a physics major but

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,850
switched before graduation to
studying English literature.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,490
He then pursued a career as
a newspaper science writer.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,730
He's covered science news for three daily
newspapers in the US, was nominated for

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,280
a Pulitzer Prize in Journalism,
and has written several books.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,050
He's also taught writing for
many years at Boston area colleges.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,970
When John was teaching at the Berkeley
College of Music, he invented a new

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,990
approach to help sometimes confused and
worried students to write well.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,790
It's called the readability method.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,730
It was published by the Education
Department of Newsweek Magazine.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,830
His latest version of this approach is
described in his College Writing Guide.

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,050
John has a Bachelors and
a Master of Fine Arts degree in English.

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,010
He currently has an editing business and

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,350
teaches writing at Middlesex Community
College in Bedford, Massachusetts.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,670
Let's welcome John Maguire.

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,900
John, you wrote a wonderful article for
the Atlantic.

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,950
The Secret to Good Writing,
it's about objects, not ideas.

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,730
This is pretty counter-intuitive for
a lot of people.

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,190
I mean, most of us have been
brought up to think that writing is

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,990
all about the good ideas.

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,090
So, can you explain what you meant?

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,860
>> Yes, Barbara, it does seem strange for
a writing teacher to

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,560
say think about objects more than
you're thinking about ideas.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,060
Of course,
it is important to write about ideas.

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,290
But my point in that article was to say,
it's easy

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,630
to express ideas in terms of objects.

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,560
And what a good writer thinks
about is what objects can

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,470
I use to express my ideas?

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,610
It's not bad to use idea words, but

35
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,385
it's easy to get overrun with idea
words and use too many of them.

36
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:22,820
You can become over-abstract, and when
your writing becomes over-abstract, and

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,750
there are too many I-O-N words or
T-I-O-N words in a given passage.

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,330
It becomes very hard for
the reader to know what's going on.

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,870
And in fact, the writer often gets
confused about what he or she is saying.

40
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,170
When things become very abstract, they
become very blurry, and both the reader

41
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,990
and the writer has to spend a lot of time
figuring out what the heck is being said.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,390
The point I wanted to make is that
all ideas are related to objects.

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,440
Let me show a diagram.

44
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:06,350
Here on a white board is what we
call the ladder of abstractions.

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,350
This is a ladder that runs
from low to high, and

46
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:17,650
at the top end of the ladder are abstract
ideas, let's say, the idea of nutrition.

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,850
Now, an abstract idea is a non-physical
thing that you cannot touch.

48
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,540
At the bottom of the ladder are, connected
to the word nutrition, actual things like

49
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,530
apples, oranges, slices of bread,
hamburger sandwiches.

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,380
Any idea that you're trying to get across,
let us say you're writing about good

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,630
nutrition for pregnant women,
can be communicated in terms of things.

52
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,560
And the principle that writers follow is,
when you're writing about ideas, go down

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,690
the ladder to the world of things and
make you sure write with enough things.

54
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,630
>> So, in our course, we suggest to

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,720
learners that they should alternate
between sort of close in focus and

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,820
a more diffuse approach to learning in
order to learn something difficult.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,010
So toggling between a tight
intent sort of attention and

58
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,995
a loose sort of attention
seems to really work.

59
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:21,690
You've told me that professional writers
seem to do the same sort of switching.

60
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,800
Can you tell us how a writer switches
between focused and relaxed thinking?

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,230
>> Any creative person switches from
one mode to another frequently.

62
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,818
Maybe the best example
of this is painters.

63
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:40,590
The classic, cliche image of a painter is
somebody who is up close to the canvas,

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,770
putting a little dot of paint on.

65
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,510
And then,
he backs up halfway across the room,

66
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,540
takes a look at what the effect has been
of that dot of paint, thinks about it,

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,600
weighs it, goes back in, puts some
more dots of paint on the painting.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,700
The shifting of focus from up close to far
back is obvious in the world of a painter.

69
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,790
You have spoken about how important
that is in the world of math.

70
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,580
And how, when you are leaning equations,
it's a good idea to come in close, and

71
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,310
really master what you need to know and
sometimes it's a good idea to

72
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,250
pull back in order to understand the
problems that you have to solve with math.

73
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,625
Writers switch focus many different ways.

74
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,100
Sometimes you will turn from
what you are trying to say and

75
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,990
you'll talk to your friends and ask your
friends what they know about the subject.

76
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,030
That broadens out the discussion
of what you're trying to say.

77
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,719
Sometimes you will shift and
do a little bit of reading.

78
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,720
Maybe go on Wikipedia for

79
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,060
five minutes to look up some material that
relates to what you're talking about.

80
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,780
Sometime you will shift writing on
a computer to writing longhand.

81
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,200
I sometimes shift from writing while
sitting down to writing while standing up.

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,850
And of course, there's the tried and
true, let's take a walk around the block.

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,830
Charles Dickens did it and if he did it,

84
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,250
it's good enough for me and for
college writers, I would say.

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,170
>> I see.

86
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,910
So beyond concrete nouns or
things, what other advice do

87
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,190
you give your students about what
they should put into their writing?

88
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,700
Barbara, writing well is a matter
of choosing a good style, and

89
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,870
style is basically the choice of what kind
of words are you going to write with.

90
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,070
What parameters are you
going to have control over?

91
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,320
So beyond putting in things,
which is very important,

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,580
I tell my students, put in active verbs.

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,140
These are verbs that make
something happen on the page.

94
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,660
I also tell them to put in people.

95
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,100
How do you put people
into a piece of writing?

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,716
You name them.

97
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:47,700
Full name or nickname, name some people.

98
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,210
Put them into your writing.

99
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,360
Use some active verbs.

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,760
Make things happen on the page.

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,500
Other pieces of advice I suggest are,

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,880
use short words when you can instead
of long ones, and use short sentences.

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,060
It's often important, especially for

104
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,040
beginning writers, not to let their
sentences get out of control too long.

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,110
When in doubt, write it short.

106
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,970
>> Have you ever taught students for
whom English was their second language?

107
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,500
What can you tell a student who has
learned to write outside an English

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,330
speaking country?

109
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,110
>> Yes, I have taught people to
write who were ESL speakers.

110
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,620
One of the more interesting friends I made
recently was a young man named Saktai.

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,830
I taught him last semester
in the city of Lowell.

112
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,390
The first papers he turned in
were really pretty terrible.

113
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,210
I asked him why he wrote that way and
he told me he had been taught to

114
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,820
write that way by his teacher
back in I think it was Vietnam.

115
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,480
And I said, you are out of control
with what you're saying here.

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,520
You have to be simpler.

117
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,910
And he told me that his teacher had told
him, make sure you use your long words and

118
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,370
show people that you're educated.

119
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,920
That's the way to write.

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,000
And, I said to him Saktai,
that's not the way we do it in English.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,050
In English, we really favor the plain
style, which means clear and simple.

122
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,416
So I'm going to give you some advice,
young man,

123
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,110
I said, trying to get his attention.

124
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,640
I want you to stop trying to be impressive
and just start trying to be clear.

125
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,590
I had to say it a couple of times.

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,040
And I told him this, I said, once you are
clear then you're going to be impressive.

127
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,330
So stop trying to be impressive,
just work on being completely clear.

128
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,800
About four weeks later,
his writing had improved quite a bit, and,

129
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,930
he came to me and
said that the advice that I had

130
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,080
given him to stop trying to be impressive
and just to be clear had really worked.

131
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,140
Nobody had ever told him that before,
he really needed to hear it.

132
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,240
Now he understood what he had to do, and
he felt much more powerful as a writer.

133
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,710
Instead of trying to do two things
at once, which was to be clear and

134
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,690
to be impressive,
he just tried to be clear.

135
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,190
And as we both know, when you read
something that is really clear,

136
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,630
after you finish reading it you say,
wow, that was impressive.

137
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,055
And that's the way it works,
clarity first.

138
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:24,210
>> [LAUGH] What a great point.

139
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,510
It is funny, when I, I read research
papers, I can always tell a difference

140
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,810
between the second tier, the sort of
lower caliber research papers and

141
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,470
the upper tier research papers, because
the lower caliber ones are often fuzzy.

142
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,100
They use a lot of big words.

143
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,290
They're hard to read.

144
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,560
They're hard to understand.

145
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,170
But the ones that really are top notch,
they're often so

146
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,170
simple and so elegantly written.

147
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,260
And, and you, you might say, well, you
know, that's not academic writing because

148
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,590
it's too elegant, but that's actually the
very best of writing in any discipline.

149
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,810
So some teachers,
let me ask you about this.

150
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,520
Some teachers tell students
not to edit as they

151
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,470
write because they think it's a bad idea.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,250
How do you feel about that?

153
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,899
>> I agree with those coaches who say
separate the writing from the editing.

154
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,470
Writing is a matter of getting things down
on the paper, or on the screen rapidly.

155
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,870
You want to maintain
rapid forward progress.

156
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,400
You don't want to get stuck and
lose your momentum.

157
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,540
Editing is a process of being judgmental,
deciding whether things are working.

158
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,260
And if you're not a very good writer, if
you're a beginning writer, it's possible

159
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,500
to produce a bad sentence and then be
totally stymied about how to fix it,

160
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,900
and spend minutes puzzling over
something stupid that you've written.

161
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,300
Far better to choose to maintain
your momentum, roll forward.

162
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,660
You want to get the conveyor
belt of ideas rolling.

163
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,877
After lots of material that's
come out of your idea factory and

164
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:09,870
your writing factory,
then you can change gears and edit.

165
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,010
I have another idea about editing
which is that it's often useful to

166
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,749
print out a draft and edit on paper.

167
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,451
I do that.

168
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:26,031
I think a great many professional writers
will print out a draft, edit it on paper,

169
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:31,370
and then enter their edits back into
the computer version of the text.

170
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,950
>> That sounds like great advice.

171
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,420
I know for me, when I'm writing and
I find myself really getting stuck,

172
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,790
it's generally because I'm starting
to edit while I'm writing.

173
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,570
And so often I'll find that I,
if I just let go and let it come out,

174
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,205
later on, mostly I find it's not as bad
as I thought when I was writing it.

175
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:55,510
because usually when it comes out,
I'm thinking oh, it's terrible.

176
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,590
But it comes out and it, and I do
a little tweaking and it's not too bad.

177
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,730
So suppose a student really
wants to write better.

178
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,200
Is there some special technique of reading
that will help improve your writing?

179
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,800
>> Well,
read closely the people you admire.

180
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,590
If you're writing short stories,
read the short stories you admire.

181
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,120
But if you're writing scientific papers or
term papers,

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,160
things to be published in journals,
read the writers whom you admire.

183
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,750
If there is somebody who is great in your
field and he has produced very interesting

184
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,170
papers that read well,
your job is to study what he or she did.

185
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,080
I would recommend looking closely at
the openings of papers that you like.

186
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,740
Perhaps, copying the opening
paragraph down longhand.

187
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,070
I would also recommend, underlining words
that he uses that you might not use but

188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,110
you can consider using.

189
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,460
I would recommend you study
your writer's sentence length.

190
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,300
How long are his sentences?

191
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,030
What is the pattern of long sentences and
short sentences that your hero uses?

192
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,909
I would recommend looking for a sentence
that he wrote that you would think you

193
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:22,550
could never write because it's not
in your nature, and then go and

194
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,469
write that sentence out
longhand a couple of times.

195
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,630
Study what you admire.

196
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,330
>> So what if you're writing
a paper on a scientific

197
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,220
topic which focuses around
something like molecules?

198
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,380
They're too small to be
dropped on your foot.

199
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,560
How can you make that
somehow more concrete?

200
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,090
>> Good writers are always
thinking of their readers.

201
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,120
A good writer is thinking,
how is my reader going to understand this?

202
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
A good writer is thinking,

203
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,570
what is my reader going to see in
his head when he reads my words?

204
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,340
So this can produce a problem if you're
writing on a scientific topic, say,

205
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,930
about molecules.

206
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,410
After all, molecules are too
small to be dropped on your foot.

207
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:12,280
That's no excuse to stop
thinking physically.

208
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,800
You can, if you're writing about a simple
molecule like the molecule of water,

209
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,080
you can make a visual metaphor.

210
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:27,380
You know, a grapefruit with two lemons
attached to it will, can stand for H2O.

211
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,280
Or, you can go looking for
the physical objects that are related to

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,590
the chemical research
you're writing about.

213
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:40,580
You can put in as appropriate,
test tubes or Bunsen burners or

214
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,570
beakers, or spectrophotometers,
or a laboratory bench.

215
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,510
It's a skill to go looking for
physical correlates to your topic, but

216
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,090
it's a skill that you can
get good at pretty quick.

217
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,920
And it pays off because you always want
to give the reader something to see.

218
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,970
>> I think that's very helpful advice.

219
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,300
So, tell me now, what's more important,
the words or the ideas?

220
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,073
>> As far as the writer is concerned,

221
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:17,054
there are no ideas outside
of the realm of words.

222
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:20,693
Now I will grant you,
there are wordless intuitions and

223
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:23,090
little images you might get.

224
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,100
There are diagrams you can put on
a piece of paper to capture an idea.

225
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,450
But when it comes to being a writer,

226
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,910
your job is to make sure
everything gets down in words.

227
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,300
So if you were to ask me which is more
important in a paper, the words or

228
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,380
the ideas?

229
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,100
I say it's the words.

230
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,840
I'd say, without the right
words in the right order,

231
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,690
you do not have any ideas to work with.

232
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,630
As a writer, if you don't have it down
in a sentence, you don't have an idea.

233
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,420
>> Very good advice.

234
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,840
So, some coaches talk about the problem
of having too little to say.

235
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,930
What if a student writer discovers
that he or she has too little to say?

236
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,270
What or how can she or he deal with that?

237
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,420
>> I think a student who has quote,

238
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:22,260
too little to say, is usually a student
whose imagination is too narrow.

239
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,440
Often, it's a student who has decided
to write about an abstract topic and

240
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,119
has just kept focusing on the abstraction.

241
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,020
When a student is, seems to be devoid of
ideas, when a writer is devoid of ideas,

242
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,690
he or she should slow down and
brainstorm and brainstorm wildly.

243
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,920
Go to a piece of paper and write down
everything you know about the topic, draw

244
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,980
diagrams on a piece of paper, draw idea
maps or mind maps, make lists of objects.

245
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,450
Shift the focus, in other words.

246
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,530
A student who doesn't have enough
to say has often gotten too

247
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,500
tense in trying to say
something important.

248
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,320
It's a good idea to stop trying
to say something important and

249
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,430
just try to say something simple and
clear.

250
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,790
You can find your way to the simple and

251
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,870
clear by talking with a friend,
or by taking a walk, as I said.

252
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,460
Another thing to do is to write
some questions down for yourself.

253
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,820
You don't have to be an expert
on what you're writing about,

254
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,510
you just have to be clear.

255
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,280
Write down what puzzles you.

256
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,800
Write down what confuses you.

257
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,540
I am confused about x.

258
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,530
I am puzzled about how x relates to y.

259
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:45,560
Write these things down, cover several
pieces of paper with ideas and sketches.

260
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,360
It can even look like this.

261
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,730
Tape them together.

262
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,430
Cover a bunch of paper, with notes.

263
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,210
Tape them together.

264
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,090
Set them down on your desk and
go out for a half an hours walk.

265
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,430
When you come back, start again.

266
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,220
You will have more ideas.

267
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,340
>> That's a, a, I, I like that approach.

268
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,380
So, do you have any final takeaways or
advice for writing students?

269
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,750
What's one thing a student
writer can do to write better?

270
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,210
>> I'll give you a couple of things
a writer can do to make things better.

271
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,100
In terms of readability,
I would suggest using short sentences.

272
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,515
A writer ought to go into his paper, and

273
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,500
if he has written any really
long sentences, ask himself,

274
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,930
do these sentences have to be this long,
and replace them with shorter sentences.

275
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,510
In terms of completeness,
a writer can do two things.

276
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,080
It's asking himself a couple of questions.

277
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,830
The first one is, what am I trying to say?

278
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,720
Did I say it clearly?

279
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,990
And the second one is,
what must I not leave out?

280
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,790
The very last question, which is,
what must I make sure not to leave out?

281
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,280
It's very useful.

282
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,670
I use it myself all the time at the,
as I get to the end of a draft.

283
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,712
I then ask myself, did I cover everything?

284
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:15,370
And in particular, is there anything
I must make sure not to leave out?

285
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,770
Often it turns out I have
left out something important.

286
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,310
So, those are my final words on this.

287
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,590
>> I think that's a helpful
approach even for me.

288
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,840
So, I, I just want to emphasize
how important I think good

289
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,800
writing actually is to
the learning process.

290
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,260
I often find, myself, that I really

291
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,240
learn something in the best way
when I attempt to write about it.

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,717
So, I think this is why
insight from people like you,

293
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:50,294
who've, who've really worked to
understand the writing process.

294
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:54,698
Here is your,
your book College Writing Guide.

295
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,411
It is very, very helpful.

296
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,036
So here, you can see clearly now.

297
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:04,968
And so I just very, very,
very much appreciate John your interview

298
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:10,710
with me here today and thank you,
we'll see you on the flip side.
