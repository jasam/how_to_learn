[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:06,910
We've mentioned it earlier, but it's worth
repeating.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,390
Testing is itself an extraordinarily
powerful, learning experience.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,090
This means that the effort you put

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,830
into test-taking, including the preliminary
mini test of

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,590
your recall and your ability to problem

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,860
solve during your preparation is of
fundamental importance.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,340
If you compare how much you learn by
spending

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,810
one hour studying, versus one hour taking
a test on

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,770
that same material, you'll retain and
learn far more as

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,170
a result of the hour you spent taking a
test.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,300
Testing, it seems, has a wonderful way of
concentrating the mind.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,880
Virtually everything we've talked about in
this course

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,530
has been designed to help make the testing
process

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,500
seem straightforward and natural, simply
an extension of

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,260
the normal procedures you use to learn
the material.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,860
So it's time now to cut directly to one of
the final features of this course.

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,290
A checklist, you can use to see whether

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,702
your preparation for test taking is on
target.

20
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:11,560
This checklist was developed by legendary
educator Richard Felder.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,470
Although, it was originally developed for

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,480
engineers, it's actually suitable for many
disciplines.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,610
As Doctor Felder says the answer to the
question, how should I prepare

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,140
for the test, is do whatever it takes to
be able to answer, yes.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,740
Meaning, usually to most of the questions
on this list.

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,950
Did you make a serious effort to
understand the text?

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,640
Just hunting for relevent worked-out
examples doesn't count.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,470
Did you work with classmates on homework
problems

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,700
or at least check your solutions with
others?

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Did you attempt to outline every

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,050
homework problem solution before working
with classmates?

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,220
Did you participate actively in homework

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,480
group discussions contributing ideas and
asking questions?

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,930
Did you consult with the instructor or
teaching

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,280
assistants when you were having trouble
with something?

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,670
Did you understand all your homework

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,670
problem solutions when they were handed
in?

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,800
Did you ask in class for explanations of

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,110
homework problem solutions that weren't
clear to you?

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,490
If you had a study guide, did you
carefully go through it

41
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,410
before the test and convince yourself you
could do everything on it?

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,810
Did you attempt to outline lots of
problem solutions

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,580
quickly without spending time on the
Algebra in calculations?

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,440
Did you go over the study guide and

45
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,200
problems with class mates and quiz one
another?

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,610
If there was a review session before the
test, did

47
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,090
you attended and asked questions about
anything you weren't sure about?

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,390
And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's
sleep before the test?

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,599
If your answer is no, your answers to all
the preceding questions may not matter.

50
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,160
Taking a test is serious business.

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,180
Just as fighter pilots and doctors

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,340
go through checklists before takeoff and
surgery.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,930
Going through your own test preparation
checklist

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,750
can vastly improve your chances of
success.

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,410
The answer to the question.

56
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,900
How should I prepare for the test becomes

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,720
clear once you've filled our Doctor
Felder's checklist.

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,140
I'm Barbara Oakley.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,270
Thanks for learning How to Learn.
