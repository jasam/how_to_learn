[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,223
In this video, I'm very pleased to

3
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:11,101
introduce you to Dr. Richard Felder and
Dr.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,827
Rebecca Brent, two educators who have had

5
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:17,880
an enormous impact on the landscape of
education.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,170
I first met Rich and Rebecca at the very
beginning of my teaching career.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,070
I was lucky enough to attend a workshop
they taught on student centered learning.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,303
That workshop changed the whole focus of
my teaching and

9
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:34,510
allowed me to understand learning in a
whole new, deeper way.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,830
I think you'll find that your own
understanding of

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,630
learning will change as you listen to this
interview.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,210
Rich Felder has written the best selling
book on introductory

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,240
chemical engineering in the country and
possibly in the world.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,000
He's also won the Lifetime Achievement
Award from the

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,060
American Society of Engineering Education
for his enormously influential work.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,035
But don't make the mistake of thinking
that

17
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:02,730
Dr. Felder's work is only useful for
engineers.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,330
A big reason he's so influential is that
the approaches

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,870
he uses are applicable to virtually any
field of study.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,690
It is actually Dr. Felder's enormously
gifted wife, Dr. Rebecca Brent, the

21
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,680
president of the education consulting
firm, Education Designs and long time

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,300
director of the NSF-sponsored SUCCEED

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,430
Coalition faculty development program, who
has

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,183
helped spearhead the broad
multidisciplinary impact

25
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:34,360
of the couples' work on education.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
I think you'll find Dr. Felder and Dr.
Brent's work to

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,110
have as powerful an influence on you as
it's had on me.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,930
So, you've written some extraordinarily
helpful advice

29
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,590
for students about how to prepare for
tests.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,850
If you could sum that advice up in a
nutshell, what would you say?

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,332
>> Let me first say something about how
not to prepare for tests, which is what,

32
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:06,770
probably what about 90 plus percent of my
students do to prepare for tests.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,873
One, they may read the book.

34
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:14,483
Generally, they ignore the book, but they
may read

35
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:18,011
the book like a novel, just going flipping
through

36
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:21,210
it, maybe they underline, which, as far as
I

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,038
can tell, is a singularly useless strategy
for doing anything.

38
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:29,591
And then when they've done that, maybe
they look through

39
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:33,433
the old homework solutions, and read
through them again like a

40
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:37,421
novel and then imagine that they've
studied, and that provides

41
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:40,580
them with no help at all in preparing for
the test.

42
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,470
First of all, the test is not going to be
just the homework again.

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,710
It's going to be new problems that they
have to solve.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,540
So, if that's how not to do it, how do you
do it?

45
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,010
The only way that I've ever found that
works to prepare

46
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,640
for tests is and I'm talking about problem
solving tests now,

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,480
the kind that I give in engineering, is to
work problems,

48
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,900
to set problems up, not to work through
them in detail.

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,720
So I tell the students, you can start with
the

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,532
homework problems that you solve and then
solve it again.

51
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,730
Set up the solution without looking back
at the worked

52
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,710
out solution that was graded and see how
far you get.

53
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,680
If you can set it up so the only thing
that's

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,740
left to do is algebra or simple math, then
you're done.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,170
Then go onto another problem.

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,578
Don't waste your time doing algebra and
arithmetic.

57
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,962
You're not learning anything from that,
and then maybe go to your book

58
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:39,870
and pick out another couple of problems,
and try to set those up.

59
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,520
And the more of that you do, the

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,980
better you're going to be at solving
problems, the more

61
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,950
likely you are to to be able to solve the
problems that show up on the tests.

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,580
And the other thing that I strongly advise
is work with other people.

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,520
Get into a study group.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,970
Make it a serious study group and try to
make sure that at least somebody in

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,300
the study group is smarter than you are
and really knows how to solve the problem.

66
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,430
So that if you get stuck on something,
this person's likely to be

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,950
able to figure it out, and all of you go
marching along together.

68
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,400
And leave the beer and the snacks in the
refrigerator.

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,650
Just spend your time working through
problems, setting them up, making

70
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,840
sure you know how to solve it, going on
doing more problems.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,350
And then, when you're either exhausted or
you've covered as much

72
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,770
as you need to cover, you can then hit the
refrigerator.

73
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,640
>> This is so much like what we've talked
about throughout this course as far as

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,800
simply putting, you, reading a book is not
putting it necessarily in your brain.

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,570
And to, to have to actively grasp the
material

76
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,270
and working with others sometimes is a
very good

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,890
way to help reinforce what you're learning
and also

78
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,970
fill in gaps in what you're trying to
learn about.

79
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,100
So, I think that's fabulous advice and I

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,430
have to say, thank you for that wonderful
check list.

81
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,310
>> You're welcome.

82
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,400
>> I think there's also some things you
can do when

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,960
you get in the test because sometimes it's
a high pressure situation.

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,470
You may feel a lot of anxiety.

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,300
And so, taking a moment when you get the
test, looking through the whole thing just

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,950
to get a sense of where you're going, pick
out the easy questions and start there.

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,930
And then if you get stuck somewhere, go on
to

88
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,756
something else that you, you feel
confident you can handle.

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,300
Keep moving, you know, don't stop.

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,932
Sometimes when we're anxious, we, we just
freeze.

91
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,150
And keep moving, keep working.

92
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,900
Even if you can't get everything, go for
partial credit.

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,510
>> Right.

94
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,867
>> Get some of it, put something down and

95
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,689
that will help you be more successful on
your test.

96
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:03,640
Also I've had students who really felt
rising anxiety if

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,850
they got to a question that they couldn't
answer right away.

98
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,399
If you find yourself really getting upset,
to just stop, take a

99
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,458
deep breath, pause for a moment and then
look back at it.

100
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,240
Just calming down a little bit can go a
long way.

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,260
>> Oh, it can.

102
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,756
Well, that's one of the things we've also
talked about

103
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:29,370
in the course, is breathing from the belly
to help

104
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,700
draw in and, and really do deep breathing,
that that's a very effective

105
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,040
technique to neuro-physiologically allow
yourself to calm down.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,430
And another interesting thing and I think
for our viewers this shows a bit of

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,330
the difference in approach of different
top quality educators.

108
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,510
One thing we've talked about is, just
touch at

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,850
the very beginning when you're starting to
look through

110
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,380
a test, touch on and start working some of

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,740
the more difficult problems, just until
you get stuck.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,540
So you, it takes willpower.

113
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,510
You have to pull yourself off quickly as

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,310
soon as you can detect that you're getting
stuck.

115
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,540
But that that actually gets your focused

116
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,080
attention on it, then pulls that attention
away.

117
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,530
And when you're working another, easier
problem, it allows you to,

118
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,610
to in the background, your diffuse mode
is, is working away.

119
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,420
And so, then you revisit that more
difficult problem, you've got a little

120
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,500
bit more going on intellectually because
you've had time to think about it.

121
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,465
If you wait for the, the and do the
hardest

122
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:42,220
problems later in the test, sometimes that
can create problems.

123
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,270
There's, so there's diff, different
approaches.

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,250
And I think, different folks, if they are
aware of the different kinds of approaches,

125
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,900
it gives them more tools that they can use
for their intellectual toolkits.

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,300
>> Exactly, I think that's always
important, to

127
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,450
look at all the advice, look at all the

128
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,290
suggestions, try things, give them enough
of a try

129
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,702
that you see how well they work for you.

130
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:11,123
So I think that's important for your

131
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,100
students [CROSSTALK] to always be, be
doing.

132
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,471
>> And I would extend that actually, the,
the advice you

133
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:21,980
just gave, I think is life advice, not
just for taking tests.

134
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,240
I mean, there's, there's this magical
phenomenon that I've experienced many

135
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,750
times in my life of I'm working on
something, a problem.

136
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,100
When I was a student, it might be a
problem on a homework assignment.

137
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,900
It could have been a problem on a test.

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,050
It could be a problem, it could have been
a problem

139
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,580
in my doctoral research or in a,
something I'm working on.

140
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,350
When I went into research as a faculty
member, but I'm struggling with something.

141
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,520
I can't make any headway on it.

142
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,630
My natural tendency is just to keep
grinding on

143
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,780
it and keep banging my head against that
concrete wall.

144
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,115
And it doesn't damage the wall at all.

145
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,620
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's not too good for my head.

146
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,590
And what I found is, when out of

147
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,810
desperation or just because I needed a
break

148
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,510
or whatever, I stopped grinding on it and
I went off and I did something else.

149
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,760
I took a walk, I took a nap, I went to
work on something else I was working on.

150
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,310
And then when I came around later, got
back

151
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,720
to work on the problem, the solution was
magically there.

152
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,250
And, you know, I, I, I tend to believe
what I've read in cognitive science about

153
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,100
all of the stuff going on underneath the
conscious part that I'm aware of.

154
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,914
And somewhere in that part of my brain is
somebody or

155
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:44,628
something that's a lot smarter than
whatever I think of as me.

156
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:48,361
And once I've gotten started on the
problem exactly as you've

157
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,742
just described, and then I get away from
it and it's like

158
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:54,631
I'm turning it over to that part of my
brain which

159
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:58,312
is smarter and it somehow solves the
problem when I come back.

160
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,280
There's the solution, like magic.

161
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,660
>> Yes, that's, that's the idea, is
basically when you

162
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,780
purposefully pull your attention off or
allow your attention to drift

163
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,450
off, that actually opens access to the
resting, the neural resting

164
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,410
