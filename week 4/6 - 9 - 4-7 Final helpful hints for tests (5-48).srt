2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,966
If you're a stressed out test taker, keep
in mind that

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:11,040
the body puts out chemicals such as
cortisol when it's under stress.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,970
This can cause sweaty palms, a racing
heart, a knot on the pit of your stomach.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,970
But interestingly, research finds, it's
how you interpret these symptoms.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,180
The story you tell yourself about why
you're stressed makes all the difference.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,530
If you shift your thinking from, this test
has made me

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,000
afraid, to this test has got me excited to
do my best.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,220
It can really improve your performance.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,080
Another good tip for panicky test takers
is

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,330
to momentarily turn your attention to your
breathing.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,860
Relax your stomach, place your hand on it,
and slowly draw a deep breath.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,950
Your hand should move out, even as your

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,400
whole chest is expanding outward like a
barrel.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,250
By doing this type of deep breathing,
you're

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,810
counteracting the fight or flight response
that fuels anxiety.

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,920
This calms you down.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,010
But don't just start this breathing on the
day of the test.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,840
If you practice this breathing technique
in the weeks before, just

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,600
a minute or two here or there is all it
takes.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
You'll slide more easily into the
breathing pattern during the test.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Remember, practice makes permanent.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,270
It's especially helpful deliberately
moving to a deep breathing pattern

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,190
in those final anxious moments before a
test is handed out.

25
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,790
I've gotten great tips on test taking from
top professors from around the world.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,840
And here are some of the best.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,130
Susan Sajna-Hebert, a professor of
psychology

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,690
at Lakehead University, advises her
students to

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,690
cover up the answers to multiple choice

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,080
questions and to try to recall the
information.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,982
So they can answer the question on their
own first.

32
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:03,000
If her students might complain that the
practice test was way easier

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,360
than the real one, she asks, what makes
the two situations different?

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,690
When you took the practice test, were you
at home relaxing with toons on?

35
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,610
Taking it with a fellow student?

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,960
No time limit?

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,420
Did you have the answer key and class
materials at hand?

38
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,660
These circumstances are not exactly like a
crowded classroom with

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,860
a clock ticking away and no way to access
the answers.

40
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,180
Tracy Magrann, a professor of biological
sciences at

41
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,950
Saddleback College, tells her students to
face your fears.

42
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,140
Often, your worst fear is not to get the
grade you need for your chosen career.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,960
How can you handle this?

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,700
Simple.

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,970
Have a Plan B for the alternative career.

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,620
Once you have a plan for the worst
possible contingency,

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,620
you'll be surprised that the fear will
begin to subside.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,030
Professor Magrann notes, study hard up
until the

49
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,400
day of the test and then let it go.

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,510
Tell yourself, oh well, let me just see
how many questions I can get right.

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,680
I can always pursue my other career
choice.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,530
That helps release stress, so you can
actually do

53
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,800
better and get closer to your first career
choice.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,730
And Bob Bradshaw, a professor of math at
Ohlone

55
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,690
College, tells his students about good
worry and bad worry.

56
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,390
Good worry helps provide motivation and

57
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,420
focus, while bad worry simply wastes
energy.

58
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,740
Here are a few final thoughts.

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,360
The day before a test, or tests, have a
quick,

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,490
final look over the materials to brush up
on them.

61
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,000
You'll need both your focus mode and
diffuse

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,550
mode muscles, so to speak, the next day.

63
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,530
So you don't want to push your brain too
hard.

64
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,400
You wouldn't run a ten mile race the day
before running a marathon.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,850
Don't feel guilty if you can't seem to get
yourself

66
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,370
to work too hard the day before a big
examination.

67
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,120
If you prepared properly, this seems to be
a natural reaction,

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,480
almost as if you're subconsciously pulling
back to conserve mental energy.

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,160
While taking a test, you should also
remember how your mind can trick

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,670
you into thinking that what you've done is
correct, even if it isn't.

71
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,830
This means whenever possible, you should
blink,

72
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,660
shift your attention, and then double
check

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,180
your answers using a, a big picture

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,770
prospective asking yourself, does this
really makes sense.

75
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,220
There's often more than one way to answer
a question and checking your

76
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,440
answers from different perspectives
provides a

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,220
golden opportunity for verifying what
you've done.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,870
If there's no other way to check, except
to step back through your logic,

79
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,940
keep in mind that simple issues have

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,690
tripped up even the most advanced
students.

81
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,220
Just do your best.

82
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,120
In science classes, having your units of
measurement match on each side of

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,640
the equation can provide an important clue
about whether what you've done is correct.

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,240
The order in which you work tests is also
important.

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Students generally work tests from front
to back.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,820
When you're checking your work if you
start more

87
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,530
towards the back and work towards the
front, it

88
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,380
sometimes seems to give your brain a
fresher perspective

89
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,690
that can allow you to more easily catch
errors.

90
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,880
Nothing's ever certain.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,130
Occasionally you can study hard and the
test gods simply

92
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,030
don't cooperate, but if you prepare well
by practicing and

93
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,090
building a strong mental library, and you
approach test taking

94
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,530
wisely, you'll find that luck will
increasingly be on your side.

95
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm Barbara Oakley.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
Thanks for learning how to learn.
