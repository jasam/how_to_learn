1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,670
I love reading history and being

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,360
inspired by the biographies of
extraordinary people.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,040
One of the most unusual people I've ever
read

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,890
about, is inspiring not only because he
was so extraordinary.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,830
But also, because he was so ordinary.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,200
Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal was a born
troublemaker.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,120
In rural Spain of the 1860s, there

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,120
weren't many options for oddball juvenile
delinquents.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,340
So that's how at 11 years old, Cajal found
himself in jail.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,820
Cajal was stubborn and rebellious.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,510
Who knew that Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal would
one day not only earn the

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,020
Nobel Prize, but eventually become known
as the Father of Modern Neuroscience?

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,790
Cajal was already in his early 20s when he
began

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,910
climbing from bad boy delinquency into the
traditional study of medicine.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,670
There's evidence that myelin sheaths.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,080
The fatty insulation that helps signals
move more quickly along a

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,040
neuron, don't finish developing in some
people until they're in their twenties.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,010
This may explain why teenagers often

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,190
have trouble controlling their impulsive
behavior.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,430
The wiring between the intention and the
control

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,890
areas of the brain isn't completely
formed.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,500
When you use neural circuits however, it
seems

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,720
you help build the myelin sheath over
them.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,180
Not to mention making many other
microscopic changes.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,310
Practice appears to strengthen and
reinforce

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,070
connections between different brain
regions, creating

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,090
highways between the brain's control
centers

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,510
and the centers that store knowledge.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,510
In Cajal's case, it seems his natural
maturation processes coupled with his own

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,220
efforts to develop his thinking, helped
him

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,770
to take control of his overall behavior.

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,510
It seems people can enhance the
development of their

33
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,840
neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts
that use those neurons.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,730
We're still in the infancy of
understanding neural development.

35
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,920
One thing is becoming clear, we can make
significant

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
changes in our brain by changing how we
think.

37
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:22,350
Cajal met and worked with many brilliant
scientists through his lifetime.

38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,530
People who were often far smarter than he.

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,490
In Cajal's autobiography however, he
pointed out that although brilliant people

40
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,860
can do exceptional work, just like anyone
else they can also be careless and biased.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,440
Cajal felt the key to his own success was
his perseverance.

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,340
What he called the virtue of the less
brilliant, coupled

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,390
with his flexible ability to change his
mind and admit errors.

44
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,810
Anyone, Cajal noted, even people with
average intelligence, can change their

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,299
own brains so that even the least gifted
can produce an abundant harvest.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,480
People like Charles Darwin, whose theory
of evolution has made him one of the most

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,640
influential figures in human history, are
often

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,190
thought of as these, sort of, natural
geniuses.

49
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,180
You may be surprised to learn that much

50
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,800
like Cajal, Darwin was a poor student in
school.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,390
He washed out of medical school and ended
up, to his father's

52
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,110
horror, heading out on a round the world
voyage as the ship's naturalist.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,090
Out on his own, Darwin was able to look

54
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,810
with fresh eyes at the data he was
collecting.

55
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,810
Approaching material with a goal of
learning it on

56
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,130
your own, can give you a unique path to
mastery.

57
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,100
Often no matter how good your teacher and
textbook are, it's only when you sneak

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,140
off and look at other books or videos that
you begin to see what you learn

59
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,490
through a single teacher, or book, is

60
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,190
a partial version of the full three
dimensional

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,000
reality of the subject, which has links to

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,590
still other fascinating topics that are of
your choosing.

63
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,930
Taking responsibility for your own
learning is one

64
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,166
of the most important things you can do.

65
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:16,350
Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal had a deep
understanding, not only of how to

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,460
conduct science but also of how people
just interact with one another.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,690
He warned fellow learners that there will
always be those who

68
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,480
criticize or attempt to undermine any
effort or achievement you make.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,190
This happens to everybody.

70
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,680
Not just Nobel Prize winners.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,550
If you do well in your studies, the people
around you can feel threatened.

72
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,040
The greater your achievement, the more
other

73
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,810
people will sometimes attack and demean
your efforts.

74
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,170
On the other hand, if you flunk a test,
you also may

75
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,450
encounter critics who throw more barbs,
saying you don't have what it takes.

76
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,800
We're often told that empathy is
universally beneficial.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,180
But it's not.

78
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,820
It's important to learn to switch on an
occasional cool dispassion that helps you

79
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,560
to not only focus on what you're trying to
learn, but also to

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,620
tune people out if you discover that

81
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,000
their interests lie in undercutting you
such undercutting

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
is all too common, as people are

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,960
often just as competitive as they are
cooperative.

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,500
When you're a young person, mastering such
dispassion can be difficult.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,420
We're naturally excited about what we're
working on, and we like to believe that

86
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,676
everyone can be reasoned with and then,

87
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:35,708
almost everyone is naturally good hearted
towards us.

88
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,790
Like Santiago Ram贸n y Cajal, you can take
pride in aiming for success.

89
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,400
Because of the very things that make other
people say you can't do it.

90
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,380
Take pride in who you are.

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,690
Especially, in the qualities that make you
different.

92
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,900
And use them as a secret talisman for
success.

93
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,820
Use your natural contrariness to defy
the always

94
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,700
present prejudices from others about what
you can accomplish.

95
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,150
I'm Barbara Oakley.

96
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,410
Thanks for learning about learning
