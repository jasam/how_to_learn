2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:10,137
One of the best things you can do to not
only remember,

3
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:14,700
but understand concepts, is to create a
metaphor or analogy for them.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,770
Often the more visual the better.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,280
A metaphor is just a way of realizing that
one thing is somehow similar to another.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,320
Simple ideas like one geography teacher's
description

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,050
of Syria is shaped like a bowl of

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,410
cereal, and Jordan as a Nike Air Jordan

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,320
sneaker, can stick with a student for
decades.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,810
If you're trying to understand electrical
current,

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,750
it can help to visualize it as water.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,750
Similarly, electrical voltage can feel
like pressure.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,080
A push.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,070
As you climb to a more sophisticated

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,510
understanding of whatever topic you're
concentrating on,

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,320
you can revise your metaphors or toss them
away and create more meaningful ones.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
Metaphors and visualization, being able to
see something

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,180
in your mind's eye, have been especially
helpful not

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,880
only in art and literature, but also in

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,180
allowing the scientific and engineering
world to make progress.

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,140
In the 1800s for example, when chemists
began to imagine and visualize the

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,110
miniature world of molecules, dramatic
progress began to be made.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,690
Here's a fun illustration of monkeys in a
benzene ring from

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,900
an insider spoof of German Academic
Chemical Life printed in 1886.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,530
Note the single bonds, or the monkeys'
hands,

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,420
and the double bonds with their tiny
little tails.

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,886
It's often helpful to pretend that you are
the concept you're trying to understand.

28
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:46,410
Put yourself in an electron's warm and
fuzzy

29
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,040
slippers as it burrows through a slab of
copper.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,850
Or sneak inside the X of an algebraic
equation and feel

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,120
what it's like to poke your head out of
the rabbit hole.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,390
But just don't let it get exploded by an
inadvertent divide by zero.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,662
In chemistry, compare a cation with a cat
that has paws and is therefore pawsitive.

34
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:14,330
And an anion with an onion that's
negative, because it makes you cry.

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,550
Metaphors are never perfect, but then in
science, all models

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,520
are just metaphors which means they break
down at some point.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,830
But nevermind that.

38
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,850
Metaphors and models are often vitally

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,630
important in giving a physical
understanding of

40
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,030
the central idea behind the process or
concept you are trying to understand.

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,295
Interestingly, metaphors and analogies are
useful for getting people out of

42
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:46,490
Einstellung that is, being blocked by
thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,280
For example, telling a simple story of
soldiers attacking

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,410
a fortress from many different directions
at once can open

45
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,840
creative paths for students to see how
many low-intensity

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,520
rays can be effectively used to destroy a
cancerous tumor.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,880
Stories, even if they're just used as
silly memory tricks, can

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,360
also allow you to more easily retain what
you're trying to learn.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,380
Metaphors also help glue an idea into your
mind.

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,920
Because they make a connection to neural
structures that are already there.

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,420
It's like being able to trace a pattern
with tracing paper.

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,350
Metaphors at least help you get a sense of
what's going on.

53
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm Barbara Oakley.

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,786
Thanks for learning how to learn.

55
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:32,210
