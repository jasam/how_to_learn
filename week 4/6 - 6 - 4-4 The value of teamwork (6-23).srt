[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,640
This is a CT scan.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,350
If you look carefully, the shadowed region
right here

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,090
reveals the damage caused by right
hemisphere ischemic stroke.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,010
Such a stroke can cause an unusual
condition

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,430
known as broad-perspective perceptual
disorder of the right hemisphere.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,540
People with this disorder can still
function, but only partially.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,980
They can retain their intelligence, even a
formidable way for solving

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,015
complex math problems, if that was a skill
they'd had before.

10
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,870
But an interesting anomaly, however, is if
they make

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,760
a mistake in their calculations,
concluding something nonsensical, such as

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,310
that a hot dog stand had a, a profit and

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,790
loss statement with a loss of nearly a
billion dollars.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,140
It doesn't bother them.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,100
There's no big picture, click, that says,
wait

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,660
a minute, that answer does not make sense.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,260
Although we need to be careful about

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,900
faulty and superficial left brain, right
brain assumptions.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,430
We also don't want to throw the baby out
with the bath water, and ignore

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,710
worthwhile research that gives intriguing
hints about

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,430
differences between the two hemispheres of
the brain.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,010
There's a great deal of evidence from
research that the right hemisphere

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,340
helps us step back and put our work into
big picture perspective.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,810
People with damage to the right hemisphere
are often unable to gain ah-ha, insights.

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,610
The right hemisphere, as it turns out, is
vitally important

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,350
in getting into the right track and doing
reality checks.

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,820
People with strokes can remind us of the
dangers of not

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,080
using our full cognitive abilities, which
involve many areas of our brain.

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,760
Even subtle avoidance of some of our
capabilities

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,020
can have a surprisingly negative impact on
our work.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,950
In some sense, when you whiz through a

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,210
homework or test question and don't go
back to

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,940
check your work, you're acting a little
like a

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,840
person who's refusing to use parts of your
brain.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,610
You're not stopping to take a mental
breath.

36
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,890
And then revisit what you've done with the
bigger

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,920
picture in mind to see whether it makes
sense.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,770
As leading neuroscientist Vilayanur S
Ramachandran has

39
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,460
noted, the right hemisphere serves as a

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,020
sort of devil's advocate to question the

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,720
status quo and look for global
inconsistencies.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,870
While the left hemisphere instead tries to
cling tenaciously to the way things were.

43
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,210
This echos the pioneering work of
psychologist

44
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,970
Michael Gazzaniga who posited that the
left hemisphere

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,840
interprets the world for us and will go

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,500
to great lengths to keep those
interpretations unchanging.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,620
When you work in the focus mode, it's easy

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,680
to make minor mistakes in your assumptions
or calculations.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,280
If you go off track early on, it doesn't

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,520
matter if the rest of your work is
correct.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,450
Your answer is still wrong.

52
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,560
Sometimes, it's even laughably wrong.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,250
The equivalent of calculating a
circumference of the

54
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,618
earth that's only two and a half feet
around.

55
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:14,320
But these non-sensical results just don't
matter to you because the more left

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,880
centered focus mode has associated with it
a desire to cling to what you've done.

57
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,530
That's the problem with the focus,
sometimes

58
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,980
a bit left hemisphere leaning mode of
analysis.

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,790
It provides for an analytical and upbeat
approach, but abundant research evidence

60
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,040
suggests there's a potential for rigidity,
dogmatism, and egocentricity.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,470
When you're absolutely certain that what
you've done on

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,510
a homework or test is fine, thank you very
much,

63
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,040
be aware that this feeling may be based on

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,270
overly confident perspectives arising in
part from the left hemisphere.

65
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,960
When you step back and recheck, you're
allowing for more interaction between

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,290
the hemispheres, taking advantage of the

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,060
special perspectives and abilities of
each.

68
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,960
Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard
Feynman perhaps said it best when he

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,280
pointed out, the first principle is that
you must not fool yourself.

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,910
And you are the easiest person to fool.

71
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,620
One of the best ways to catch your blind
spots and errors is

72
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,375
to brainstorm and work with others who are
also smartly focused on the topic.

73
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:30,100
It's sometimes just not enough to use more
of your own neural horsepower.

74
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,640
Both modes and hemispheres to analyze your
work.

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,980
After all, everyone has blind spots.

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,520
You're naively upbeat focused mode can
still skip right over

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,740
errors, especially if you're the one who
committed the original errors.

78
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,490
Worse yet, sometimes you can blindly
believe you've

79
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,690
got everything nailed down intellectually,
but you haven't.

80
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,350
This is the kind of thing that can leave
you in

81
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,510
shock when you discover you've flunked the
test you thought you aced.

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,530
By making it a point to do some of your
studying with

83
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,450
friends, you can more easily catch where
your thinking has gone astray.

84
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,430
Friends and teammates can serve as sort

85
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,820
of ever questioning larger scale diffuse
mode

86
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,060
outside your brain that can catch what you
missed, or what you just can't see.

87
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,910
And of course, explaining to friends helps
build your own understanding.

88
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,270
The importance of working with others
doesn't just relate to learning.

89
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,890
It's also important in career building.

90
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,420
A single small tip from a teammate to

91
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,280
take a course from the outstanding
Professor Passionate, or

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,420
to check out a new job opening, can

93
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,110
make an extraordinary difference in how
your life unfolds.

94
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,900
A word of warning, however.

95
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,210
Study groups can be powerfully effective
for learning, but if

96
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,130
study sessions turn into socializing
occasions, all bets are off.

97
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,560
Keep small talk to a minimum, get your
group on track.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,150
And finish your work.

99
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,130
If you find that your group meetings start

100
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,280
five to 15 minutes late, members haven't
read

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,370
the material, and the conversation
consistently veers off

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,910
topic, you're best off to find another
group.

103
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,510
I'm Barbra Oakley, thanks for learning how
to learn.
