1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,900
Okay.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,650
You've written a little bit about
something called the Imposter Syndrome.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,770
What is the Imposter Syndrome?

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,260
And how can students overcome it?

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,690
>> Okay.
The Imposter Syndrome is like a tape

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,190
that plays inside people's heads.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,850
Not just students a lot of people.

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,510
And, and the tape,
let's do it in a student context, though.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,510
The tape is like this.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,700
So the student is sitting in class,
looking around and thinking, boy,

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,200
these people are really good.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,690
They get this stuff.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,170
They can ask,
answer the teacher's questions.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,420
They can do the homework.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,670
You know, they can do fine on the test.

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,760
But I, the tape inside the head continues,
I'm really not.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,690
I, they all,
I managed to fool them all over the years,

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,640
the tape goes, my friends, my family, my
teachers, into thinking that I'm this real

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,420
hotshot who belongs at this first
class university, taking engineering,

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,700
taking science, taking economics,
whatever i'm taking.

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,860
But I know better, and the tape continues.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,900
The very next tough question I get in
class, the very next hard test that I

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,310
have to take, that's what's
going to finally, once and for all,

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,580
reveal me as the fraud, the phony,
the imposter, that I know I am.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:36,300
And then, and then, what happens then,
is usually too horrifying to contemplate.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,045
And so, at that point, the imposter
usually stops the tape, rewinds it.

27
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,580
>> [LAUGH].

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,675
>> Gets it going again.

29
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:48,680
And the interesting thing about that
phenomenon is how utterly common it is.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,860
But every student playing
that tape imagines that he or

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,450
she is the only one who's doing it.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,570
And the idea that a lot
of people are doing it,

33
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,890
and that hot shot in the front
row with the 4.0 average,

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,830
the tape is playing louder than
it is in anyone else's head.

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,450
It comes as a surprise to them.

36
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,560
And the reason that I'm so
sure about how common this phenomenon is,

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,615
is that I've given this talk
many times to students.

38
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:18,200
So I'm in an auditorium full of
students that i'm giving this talk to.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,100
And when I get to the part about,
they all think I belong here,

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,380
but I know better,
it's like I plucked a guitar string.

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,280
There's a quiver that goes over
the entire audience, you know, and,

42
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,470
and eyes dilated and jaws go slack.

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,550
You know?
And then they kind of

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,910
start checking each other out.

45
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,440
And there's this tangible relaxation
that goes over the entire room,

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,200
as they realize,
this is just a scam I'm playing on myself.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,100
And it is a scam, you know?

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,380
If a student managed to do everything
needed to get into this college,

49
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,740
to pass all of the entrance requirements,
maybe to get through that difficult first

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,730
year then, obviously, they have
the ability to do it because they did it.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,700
And so when I make that speech,
as I say, it relaxes a lot of students.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,240
And once you're familiar with
that phenomenon, what happens is,

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,990
imposters keep showing up.

54
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,770
I, in my office not a week goes
by that I don't see two or

55
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,410
three imposters coming into my office.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,440
And as soon as they start talking about
the problems that they're having I,

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,390
okay, here's another imposter.

58
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,290
And I reach into the left middle drawer
of my desk in, in a file folder there.

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,970
I pull out a little copy of a little
column that I wrote on the imposter

60
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,275
phenomenon, and I say here check this out,
you might find it intriguing.

61
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:48,800
And so this imposter in my office
reads his or her biography.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,450
And it's high drama, you know?

63
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,600
I get tears from male and
female imposters.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,356
I get, you know, practically screaming.

65
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:03,235
I had one one woman student
accuse me of stealing her diary.

66
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,050
>> [LAUGH]
>> And so, it,

67
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,630
it's a really good thing for
teachers to know about, and it's a very,

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,330
very good thing for students to know
about, because we're all playing it.

69
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,370
>> It may surprise you to know that a lot
of us have that imposter feeling often.

70
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,706
And that's something that each of us has,

71
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:32,100
has struggled with in our whole adult
lives as well as when we were students.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,680
And the, the power,
I think, is in naming it.

73
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,610
It's the imposter.

74
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,560
And once you realize that that's
what you're doing, then it,

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
it diffuses a lot of the power.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,470
You can just remind yourself, okay,
I know how to do this, I can,

77
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,430
this may be something new, but I've met
challenges before, I'll meet this one.

78
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,550
I can do it.

79
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,880
And, and go ahead and, and push on.

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,080
And you'll find that,
as you get into whatever the task may be,

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,310
that you settle down and
you realize you really can do it.

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,064
And you have resources
if you have trouble.

83
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,110
>> Right.
So,

84
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,080
now let's turn to something
a little different.

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,593
What do you both do to avoid
procrastination when it

86
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:23,890
comes to something you'd
really rather not be doing?

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,350
Do you ever struggle with this?

88
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,050
It's hard to think that do these,.

89
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,174
>> Let me get,
let me get to you later on that.

90
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:31,229
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH].

91
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,895
>> We, when, when we figure it out,
we'll let you know.

92
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:40,230
>> [LAUGH]
>> Now, we definitely both struggle with

93
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,290
it, as I'm sure you,
you knew when you asked that question.

94
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,780
And we found some strategies for
each of us that work.

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,980
But it is still something we,
we struggle with.

96
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,780
I like to,
to try to schedule myself if I got a big task

97
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,965
schedule a small amount of time everyday
to work on it, to do just a little bit.

98
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:08,780
>> Mm-hm.
>> Not try to

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,300
do everything all at once but
to bite off a small, a small chunk.

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:21,150
I've also found it to be really helpful
where I keep a to-do list on my phone.

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:28,494
And I, if I break the task down into
smaller pieces, what's the very next thing

102
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:35,790
that I need to do that's manageable
then that makes it less overwhelming.

103
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,710
And I'm able to, to get going on it.

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,490
And once you get started,
it's easier to keep going.

105
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,254
>> Oh, absolutely.

106
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,740
>> the, this is one area where Rebecca and

107
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,910
I are exactly on the same page
because I use the same strategies.

108
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,200
There were two points in
the strategy that she mentioned,

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,430
which I'll just reiterate, one is breaking
it up into small pieces, you know?

110
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,730
If I think I've got to write the book, or
I've got to write the dissertation, or

111
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:09,290
I've got to write the 25-page proposal,
it's Mount Everest.

112
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,900
And it's very hard to get
myself to take that first step.

113
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,530
But if I say,
I've got to write the first two pages of

114
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,250
the introduction to this
thing that I can do.

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,840
That's not that formidable.

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,570
And so if I just break it
up into small pieces and

117
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,830
set easy targets for myself,
then I can keep marching.

118
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,680
And then the other
suggestion that she made,

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,940
which I would agree with is make
appointments with yourself.

120
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,620
So if if I work well in the morning,
I'm a morning person I,

121
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,926
I think well, I'm clear headed then,
then 10 o'clock to

122
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:56,570
10:30 every morning on my calendar,
I make an appointment with myself.

123
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,550
I'm going to work on that proposal,
for that half hour.

124
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,828
Then, I'll stop and
I'll go back to the rest of my life.

125
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:08,320
Next day, 10:00,
assuming I don't have other,

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,010
other obligations at 10:00,
I'll do another half hour on it.

127
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,220
And it's incredible how stuff gets done
when you can do things on a regular basis.

128
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,590
And the ones that you're
most reluctant to do,

129
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,000
that you're putting off because
I don't want to do that,

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,790
those are the ones that you got to
schedule appointments with yourself.

131
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,055
What a lot of people do is they work
on the block of time theory and

132
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:36,660
a time to work on the proposal now or
the term paper now.

133
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,700
But as soon as it's the weekend, as soon
as it's fall break, or anything like that,

134
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,930
that's when I'll really get it done.

135
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,540
And it doesn't work, among other things,

136
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,400
as soon as you get this block of time,
other things rush into fill it.

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,970
And also, it can be so

138
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,850
long since the last time you worked on it,
you forgot what you were doing.

139
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,950
And by the time you figure it out and
get your momentum back up,

140
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,320
the block of time may be over.

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,610
But the steady appointment to
just do the next chunk for

142
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,390
half an hour, it'll get done.

143
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,590
>> Some people find some form
of accountability is helpful.

144
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:17,441
A chart where they're
checking off the steps or

145
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:22,210
a friend who,
who will check in with them regularly.

146
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,420
How, how is it going on that project?

147
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,010
Are you making progress?

148
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,610
But those kinds of things
can be good strategies, too.

149
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,160
>> Absolutely.
Well, I'm

150
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,173
a big believer in the half hour chunk.

151
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,410
That time frame seems
to work really well for

152
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,360
me for something that I'm
having difficulty completing.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,440
And I would like to thank you ever so
much for

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,580
your incredible responses that I think
people will find enormously helpful.

155
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,238
>> For great pleasure.

156
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,448
>> Thank you.
