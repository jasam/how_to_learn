00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,950
This week, we've done a wide sweep through
some of the deepest aspects of learning.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,180
Metaphors and analogies aren't just for
art and literature.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,910
One of the best things you can do to not
only remember but more easily understand

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:25,260
concepts in many different fields, is to
create a metaphor or analogy for them.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,940
Often the more visual, the better.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,110
We've learned from Nobel prize winner
Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal that

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:37,600
if you change your thoughts, you can
really truly change your life.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,590
It seems people can enhance the
development of their

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,233
neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts
that use those neurons.

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:50,270
Like Santiago Ramon y Cajal, you can take
pride in aiming for success

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,200
because of the very things that make other
people say you can't do it.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,660
Keep in mind that when you whiz through a

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,940
homework or test question and you don't go
back

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,430
to check your work, you're acting a little
like a

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,640
person who's refusing to use parts of your
brain.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,460
You're not stopping to take a mental
breath and then revisit what you've

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,290
done with the bigger picture in mind to
see whether it makes sense.

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,060
Overconfidence in your results can result
from using only one mode of thinking.

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,820
By making it a point to do some of your
studying with

20
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,340
friends, you can more easily catch where
your thinking has gone astray.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,140
Taking a test is serious business.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,480
Just as fighter pilots and doctors go

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,330
through checklists before takeoff and
surgery,

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,150
going through your own test preparation
checklist

25
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,260
can vastly improve your chances of
success.

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,590
Counterintuitive strategies, such as the
hard start

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,470
jump to easy technique, can give your
brain

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,140
a chance to reflect on harder challenges,
even

29
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,270
as you're focusing on other, more
straightforward problems.

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,870
Here are some last test-taking pointers.

31
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,660
The body puts out chemicals when it's
under stress.

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,480
How you interpret your body's reaction to
those chemicals makes all the difference.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,380
If you shift your thinking from this test
has made me afraid to this

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,230
test has got me excited to do my best, it
helps improve your performance.

35
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,780
If you're panicked on a test, momentarily
turn your attention to your breathing.

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,520
Relax your stomach.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,690
Place your hand on it and slowly draw a
deep breath.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,810
Your hand should move outward and your
whole chest should expand like a barrel.

39
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,900
Your mind can trick you into thinking that

40
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,040
what you've done is correct, even if it
isn't.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,340
This means that whenever possible, you
should blink, shift your attention,

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,330
and then double check your answers using a
big picture perspective.

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,260
Asking yourself, does this really make
sense?

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,060
And finally, remember, that not getting
enough sleep the night

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,740
before a test can negate any other
preparation you've done.

46
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,970
I'm Barbara Oakley.

47
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,270
Thanks for learning about learning.
