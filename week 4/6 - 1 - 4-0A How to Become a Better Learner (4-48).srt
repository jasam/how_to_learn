00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,890
Welcome back to Learning How to Learn.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,450
Today we're going to talk about
how to become a better learner.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,530
As we learn more about the brain
we can become better learners, and

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,720
here are two tips for how to learn better.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,710
Tip number one, the best gift that you
can give your brain is Physical Exercise.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,260
We once thought that all of the neurons in
your brain were already present at birth,

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,840
but we now know that in a few places,
new neurons are born every day.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,730
One of these places is in your
Hippocampus, a brain area that is very

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,340
important for learning new things that we
already discussed earlier in the course.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,920
In this experiment, a rat is shown,

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,330
learning how to distinguish a picture of
a flower from a picture of an airplane.

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,970
In the background is a photo
of neurons in the hippocampus,

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,090
with the old neurons shown in blue and
newly generated neurons in red.

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,620
As the rat learns the task,
these new neurons are recruited to help

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,060
perform better pattern separation
between the two pictures.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,750
These new neurons help
you learn new things but

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,940
they will die if you don't use them.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,860
New experiences will rescue them.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,400
Exercise, interestingly,
also helps new neurons survive.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,900
Exercise is by far,

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,390
more effective than any drug on the market
today to help you learn better.

22
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,450
It benefits all of your vital organisms,
not just your brain.

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,040
It is unfortunate that
schools are dropping gym and

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,630
recess to make room for more instruction.

25
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,750
Gym and recess are by far the most
important parts of the curriculum.

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,580
Here's another tip and this has to do
with practice making perfect, but

27
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,230
only when your brain is prepared.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,550
There are certain critical periods
in the development of your brain.

29
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,970
When sudden improvements occur in specific
abilities, expect them to happen and

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,510
prepare your brain for them.

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,340
The critical period for first language
acquisition extends up to puberty.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,450
One of the best studied critical periods
in the brain is when binocular depth

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,929
perception or stereopsis matures
during the first two years of life.

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,190
Stereopsis is the magic behind Magic Eye
pictures like the one shown here.

35
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,430
If you stare at this image and

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,040
slightly cross your eyes, you will
see staircases pop out of the page.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,010
There is a slight shift between
the images in the two eyes and

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,460
your brain interprets this slight
shift as difference in depth.

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,180
Not everyone, however, can see this.

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,010
Over 5% of the population is stereo blind.

41
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,870
If the two eyes are not properly aligned
during the first two years of development,

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,930
the neurons in your visual cortex will
fail to properly strengthen the inputs

43
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,980
from the two eyes and
depth perception is permanently impaired.

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,950
Well, that's the dogma.

45
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,700
But Sue Barry, a friend of mine
from graduate school at Princeton,

46
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,260
was able to recover stereo
vision through eye exercises.

47
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,420
And wrote a book about it,

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,430
entitled Fixing My Gaze, a scientist's
journey into seeing in three dimensions.

49
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,210
Practice can repair,
as well as train the brain.

50
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,800
But this takes much longer,
past the critical period.

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,080
This brings us to zombies.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,790
Zombies can't learn.

53
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,660
It is also clear from their behavior
that they have brain damage.

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,000
Especially in the front of their cortex,

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,419
which is the part that makes plans,
as well as in their language areas.

56
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,640
Learning, Planning, Language,
these are the skills that make us human.

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,630
The prefrontal cortex is also involved
in complex analysis in social behaviors,

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,340
as well as decision making and planning.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,280
It is the last part of the cortex
to mature, so until this happens,

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,408
there may be a little
bit of zombie in you.

61
00:03:52,408 --> 00:04:00,350
Another patient, EVR, suffered a stroke in
the social parts of his prefrontal cortex.

62
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,000
EVR had a high IQ and seemed normal, but

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,700
he was ruined by making bad financial
decisions and bad social interactions.

64
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,580
He lost both his home and his family.

65
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,830
Good judgement takes a long time,
and a lot of experience to acquire.

66
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,730
Learning, is too important to
be left behind in the classroom.

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,030
Learning to learn is
a skill you can master.

68
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,960
And you can use it to improve
every part of your life.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,920
You'll be learning even more
learning tips this week, and

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,810
can follow up on them at brainfacts.org.

71
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,065
I'm Terry Sejnowski,
happy learning to you until we meet again.
