00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:03,916
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,792
This is a good place for us to step

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,840
back and look again at chunking from
another perspective.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,320
Notice what we're doing here.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,800
We're interleaving our learning by jumping
back to revisit

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,090
and deepen our understanding of a topic
we've already covered.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,480
There's an interesting connection between
learning

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,590
math and science and learning a sport.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,560
In baseball, for example, you don't learn
how to hit in one day.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,130
Instead, your body perfects your swing
from lots

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,380
and lots of repetition over a period of
years.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,190
Smooth repetition creates muscle memory,
so your body

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,520
knows what to do from a single thought.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,530
One chunk instead of having to recall all

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,340
the complex steps involved in hitting a
ball.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,040
In the same way, once you understand why
you do something in math and science.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,420
You don't have to keep re-explaining the
how to yourself every time you do it.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,670
it's not necessary to go around with a
hundred

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,320
beans in your pocket and to lay out ten

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,630
rows of ten beans again and again so you
get that ten times ten is equal to 100.

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,610
At some point you just know it from
memory.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,400
For example you memorize the idea that you
simply add exponents, those

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,610
little superscript numbers, when you are

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,450
multiplying numbers that have the same
base.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,750
Ten to the fourth times ten to the fifth
is equal to ten to the ninth.

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,600
If you use the procedure a lot, by doing
many different

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,630
types of problems you'll find that you
understand both the why

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,270
and the how behind the procedure far
better then you do

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,600
after getting a conventional explanation
from a teacher or a book.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,050
The greater understanding results from the
fact that your mind constructed the

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,850
patterns of meaning, rather than simply
accepting what someone else has told you.

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,690
Remember, people learn by trying to make
sense out of the information they perceive.

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,980
They rarely learn anything complex simply
by having someone else tell it to them.

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,630
Chess masters, emergency room physicians,
fighter pilots, and many

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,210
other experts often have to make complex
decisions rapidly.

36
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,610
They shut down their conscious system and
instead rely on their

37
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,630
well trained intuition, drawing on their
deeply ingrained repertoire of chunks.

38
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,947
At some point self-consciously understanding
why you do what you do, just

39
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:41,060
slows you down and interrupts the flow
resulting in worse decisions.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,076
But wait, are chess masters and people who
can

41
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:49,090
multiply six digit numbers in their heads
exceptionally gifted?

42
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,330
Not necessarily, I'm going to tell it to
you straight.

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,030
Sure.

44
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,520
Intelligence matters.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,210
Being smarter often equates to having a
larger working memory.

46
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,690
Your hot rod of a memory may be able to
hold nine things in mind instead of four

47
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,390
and you can latch on to those things like

48
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,330
a bulldog, which makes it easier to
learn.

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,450
But guess what, it also makes it more
difficult for you to be creative.

50
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,790
How's that?

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,620
It's our old friend and enemy Einstellung.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:24,220
The idea you are already holding in mind
can block you from fresh thoughts.

53
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,400
A superb working memory can hold its
thoughts so tightly that new

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,490
thoughts can't easily peek through. Such
tightly controlled attention could use an

55
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,600
occasional whiff of ADHD-like fresh air,
the ability,

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,020
in other words, to have your attention
shift even if you don't want it to shift.

57
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,090
If you're one of those people who can't
hold a lot in

58
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,410
mind at once, you lose focus and start
daydreaming in lectures and have

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,690
to get to some place quiet to focus so you
can use your

60
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,440
working memory to its maximum, well
welcome to the clan of the creative.

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,650
Having a somewhat smaller working memory
means you can

62
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,590
more easily generalize your learning into
new, more creative combinations.

63
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,910
Because your working memory, which grows
from the focusing abilities

64
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,370
of the prefrontal cortex doesn't lock
everything up so tightly.

65
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,860
You can more easily get input from other
parts of your brain.

66
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,540
These other areas, which include the
sensory cortex,

67
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,190
not only are more in tune with what's
going

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,240
on around you in the environment, but are
also

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,610
the source of dreams, not to mention
creative ideas.

70
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,580
You may have to work harder sometimes or
even

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,830
much of the time to understand what's
going on.

72
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,060
But once you get something chunked you can
take that chunk and turn it outside in

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,580
and inside round, putting it through
creative paces

74
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,700
even you didn't think you were capable of.

75
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,620
Here's another point to put into your
mental chunker.

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,640
It is practice, particularly deliberate
practice on

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,550
the toughest aspects of the material that

78
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,160
can help lift average brains into the
realm of those with more natural gifts.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,080
Just as you can practice lifting weights
and get bigger muscles over time,

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,535
you can also practice certain mental
patterns

81
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,590
that deepen and enlarge in your mind.

82
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,530
Whether your naturally gifted or you have
to struggle to get a solid grasp of

83
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,130
the fundamentals, you should realize that
you're

84
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,500
not alone if you think you're an imposter.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,170
That it's a fluke when you happen to do
well on a test, and then on the next

86
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,030
test, for sure they, and your family and
friends,

87
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,300
are finally going to figure out how incompetent
you really are.

88
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,810
This feeling is so extraordinarily common
that it even has a name.

89
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,150
The Imposter Syndrome.

90
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,530
If you suffer from these kinds of feelings
of

91
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,110
inadequacy just be aware that many others
secretly share them.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,670
Everyone has different gifts, as the old

93
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,470
saying goes, when one door closes, another
opens.

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,330
Keep your chin up and your eye on the open
door.

95
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm Barbara Oakley.

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,900
Thanks for learning how to learn.
