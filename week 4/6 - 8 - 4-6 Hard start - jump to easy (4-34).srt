00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,410
Now that you've gotten some insight into
how your brain works, we

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,340
can give you some final useful tricks that
can empower your test taking.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,560
The classic way students are taught to
approach

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,340
tests is to tackle the easiest problems
first.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,210
This is based on the idea that by the time
you finish

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,780
the relatively simple problems, you'll be
confident in handling the more difficult.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,380
This approach works for some people,
mostly

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,810
because, well, anything works for some
people.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,220
Unfortunately, however, for many people
it's counterproductive.

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,140
Tough problems often need lots of time,
meaning you'd

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,970
want to start on them first thing on the
test.

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,910
Difficult problems can also scream for the
creative powers of the diffuse mode.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,360
But to access the diffuse mode, you need
to not

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,860
be focusing on what you so badly want to
solve.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,210
What to do?

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,410
Easy problems first, or hard?

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,240
The answer is to start with the hard

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,880
problems but quickly jump to the easy
ones.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,120
Here's what I mean.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,410
When the test is first handed out to you,
first take

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,550
a quick look to get a sense of what it
involves.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,610
You should do this in any case.

23
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,960
Then, when you start working the problems,
start

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,570
first with what appears to be the hardest
problem.

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,870
But steel yourself to pull away within the
first minute or two, if you get

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,630
stuck or you get a sense that you might
not be on the right track.

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,720
This does something exceptionally helpful.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,870
Starting hard loads the first most
difficult problem

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,630
in mind and then switches attention away
from it.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,340
Both these activities are what allow the
diffuse mode to begin its work.

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,950
If your initial work on the first hard
problem

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,010
has unsettled you, turn next to an easy
problem.

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,900
And complete or do as much as you can.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,990
Then move, next, to another difficult
looking problem

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,200
and try to make a bit of progress.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,810
Again, change to something easier as soon
as

37
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,380
you feel yourself getting bogged down or
stuck.

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,420
When you return to the more difficult
problems, you'll often be pleased that the

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,900
next step or steps in the problem will
seem to be more obvious to you.

40
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,110
You may not be able to get all the way to
the end immediately, but at

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,220
least you can get further before you
switch

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,670
to something else of which you can make
progress.

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,620
In some sense, with this approach to test

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,230
taking, you're being a little like an
efficient chef.

45
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,050
While you're waiting for a steak to fry,
you can swiftly slice the

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,140
tomato garnish and turn to season the soup
and then stir the sizzling onions.

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,010
The hard start jump to easy technique may
make more efficient use of your brain by

48
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,060
allowing different parts of the brain to
work simultaneously on different thoughts.

49
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,900
Using the hard start jump to easy
technique on tests guarantees that

50
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,040
you will have at least a little work done
on every problem.

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,670
It's also a valuable technique for helping
you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the

52
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,250
wrong approach - because you have a chance

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,970
to look at the problem from differing
perspectives.

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,060
All of this is particularly important if
your instructor gives you partial credit.

55
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,740
The only trick with this approach is that
you must have the self discipline to

56
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,440
pull yourself off a problem once you find
yourself stuck for a minute or two.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,780
For most students it's easy, for others it
takes discipline and willpower.

58
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,020
This may be why test takers sometimes find
that the solution

59
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,930
pops to mind right as they walk out the
door.

60
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,240
When they give up, their attention

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,580
switched, allowing the diffuse mode the
tiny

62
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,520
bit of traction it needed to go to work
and return the solution.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,570
Too late of course.

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,050
Sometimes, people are concerned that
starting a problem and then

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,290
pulling away from it might cause confusion
on an examination.

66
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,840
This doesn't seem to be a problem for most
people.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,530
After all, chefs learn to bring various
facets of a dinner together.

68
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,310
But if you still have worries about
whether this strategy

69
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,030
might work for you, try it first on
homework problems.

70
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,440
Also keep in mind that if you haven't
prepared

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,700
well for a test, then all bets are off.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,840
Just take what simple points you can.

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
I'm Barbara Oakley.

74
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,726
Thanks for learning how to learn.
