00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,220
Welcome to the last video of Learning How
To Learn.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,620
If you're still listening to us, then

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,440
you've come all the way through the
course.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,790
And may remember at the beginning, I said

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,450
that brains do not come with an
instruction manual.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,600
So we have to write one ourselves.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,660
And that was one of our goals.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,310
In this final video, we want to tell

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,770
you how much we've enjoyed teaching and
learning.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,410
We've learned from you as we hoped you've
learned from us.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,470
The truth is you've always been in the

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,790
driver's seat when it comes to your own
learning.

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,870
But now that you have a better feeling for
what's under your neural hood,

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,755
you can use this to help you learn new
things all during your lifetime.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,660
>> What we're hoping is that as the days
and months will pass you'll

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,090
continue to bring to mind some of the key
ideas you've learned in the course.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,110
Approaches such as switching your mode of
thinking from focused to diffuse

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,480
can help reduce your frustration and allow
for more creative problem solving.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,830
Strengthening your chunking can give you a
firmer grasp of the material.

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,370
Even seemingly tiny changes in your daily
approach to your work.

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,765
Using the pomodoro technique, for example,
can make a dramatic

22
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:19,710
long-term difference in your learning and
in your ultimate success.

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,100
>> Learning is so vitally important to our
future that most of us spend 12 to 16 of

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,080
our earliest years of our lives in school,
culminating in high school or college.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
But the focus in formal education is on

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,640
the product of learning, not the process
of learning.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,050
In this course, we've tried to give you a
better sense of the learning process.

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,900
Although this is our last video, we hope
it's not our last chance to influence you.

29
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,000
You have not truly learned something
unless you can teach it to others.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,590
Teach those ideas to others and you will
find that

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,370
they will continue to resonate and deepen
in your own mind.

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,950
We hope you'll also have discovered how
powerful these ideas

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,190
can be at helping you broaden your
interest, passion, and expertise.

34
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,720
Many people believe that what they're
initially, sort of, naturally

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,980
good at is what they're supposed to be
doing in life.

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,340
But I myself am living proof that passions
can broaden, change, and grow.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,320
The world is evolving and a broad tool kit
that allows you to learn effectively

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,670
in many different subject areas is one of
the most powerful assets you can have.

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,060
>> Best of luck in your life of learning.

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,590
>> Ditto that.
