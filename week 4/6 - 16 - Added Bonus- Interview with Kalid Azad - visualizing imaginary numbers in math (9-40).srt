He's also authored a popular math book,
It's a pleasure to welcome Khalid.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,290
Hi Khalid, thanks for joining us I,
I have to ask you first off, what got

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,200
you interested in this wonderful intuitive
approach to learning that you use?

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,460
>> You know it actually started with a
really frustrating math class I remember I

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,870
was in my freshman year at Princeton,
you know, I had always enjoyed math in

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,170
high school, middle school and I was in
my first class and I was just getting

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,880
destroyed. It was around the midterm, and
I wasn't happy, things weren't going well.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,500
The subject that I'd always
liked just wasn't making sense

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,770
I remember the finals had come around and
I was cramming and cramming and

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,250
cramming, and suddenly some analogies
started coming to me about twists and

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,920
rotations and turns and that really
applied to the class, so I was able to

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,800
visualize the concepts instead of just
looking at the symbols and equations.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,550
And because of that,
I didn't really need to memorize anymore,

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,720
I could just think through it, and I could
walk myself through my mental diagrams and

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,640
the equations kind of snapped into place,
and so after that I realized that

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,110
a lot of learning could become so much
more pleasant and more fun after we found

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,350
the right mental metaphors, diagrams,
and analogies Instead of trying to,

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,250
you know, bash our heads against the,
the raw definitions.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,510
So from that I started trying to write and
share my, my insights that seemed to help me.

23
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,040
>> It sounds like we share the same
approach I'm, that's, that's the kind of

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,510
thing that I was trying to do,
too I finally sort of cottoned on to that.

25
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,290
So you can, can you talk a little bit more
about what approach you actually do use?

26
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,540
>> Sure just to keep things
straight in my head,

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,690
I have this little, mnemonic I use,
and I call it the ADEPT Method.

28
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,050
And basically what I'm looking for

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,410
in an explanation of something,
I try to find an analogy, a Diagram,

30
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,720
an Example, a Plain English description
and then a Technical Description.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,250
And the, the general idea is actually kind
of a C.D.M, diffused thinking Is that you,

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,940
when you're first learning, you want to
start with the sort of fuzzy overview and

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,800
then gradually sharpen it up, until you
get to the technical details at the edge.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,220
So you start with the analogy,
the diagram,

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,020
you get some examples, you have a plain,
plain English description, and

36
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,760
at the very end, that's when you
go to the technical description.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,230
And you want to save that really
focused thinking, for me, for

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,370
last because that's when I already have
the framework in place to think about it.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,180
>> Oh I like that, can you, can you share
a, a specific example of the ADEPT method?

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,240
>> Sure I think one of my favorite topics
is actually the the imaginary number,

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,430
so, most people myself included for a long
time, it is confusing, sound imaginary,

42
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,980
real safe you know, how can we use
in real life and after breaking it

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,780
down with the method, I was able to find
some metaphors that seemed to help me.

44
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,440
>> You just use an analogy,
then, to start with this?

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,320
>> Yeah, so, in this case,
imaginary numbers, a lot of the the time

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,100
we'll start the definition, the technical
definition, and that doesn't really make

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,330
things click one thing that helped me
was the analogy about a 90 degree turn.

48
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,020
So if you imagine that negative
numbers are sort of a full 180 so

49
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,910
you're going forward,
then you turn all the way 180 to backward.

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,980
A imaginary number is basically when you
start forward you actually just go up, so

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,830
instead of going all the way backward
you're actually just going up.

52
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,180
So, imagine maybe you're going east and

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,040
west negatives are sort of flipping
between east and west, but imaginary

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,880
number is the idea that hey maybe I
should take a 90 degree turn north.

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,230
So now you're going along and
woop you go north, and

56
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,000
suddenly you're in a different direction,
It's not just duress it's a new direction

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,010
it's a second dimension really and
that's kind of the key analogy behind it.

58
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,090
>> So in, in some sense then this can
actually become like a diagram or a map.

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,570
>> Exactly, this topic is really
easy to visualize because,

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,630
we already have the idea of second
dimensions and going different directions,

61
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,480
so in my head, I kind of imagine,
first a number going along,

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,370
and it gets a rotation,
which turns and then it turns again.

63
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,556
So I have this mental
diagram in my head.

64
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:14,720
And that actually leads right into
an example that well, you know,

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,880
a lot of kids wonder, well what
happens when you take four left turns?

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,230
Well if you keep turning, you'll face back
the same direction after four turns, and

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,640
with imaginary numbers
if you turn four times,

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,270
you'll face the positive numbers again.

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,240
And so the idea is that your
diagram can really, you know,

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,310
almost lead to an example that you can
figure out intuitively without having to

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,040
do a lot of math it kind of
worked through the results I got.

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,050
>> I used to do something very similar,
but

73
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,620
I had, what I had was a visual
with a toilet paper roll that was

74
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,070
unrolling because of scrolling across
the screen It was a lot of fun but,

75
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:56,210
but moving on so then you, actually
just use a plain English description.

76
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,075
>> yeah, so once you've,
wrapped your head around it

77
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:03,560
an analogy, a diagram, read about the example, start sharpening up what you've understood and

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,990
you want to describe it in your own words.

79
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,430
So rather than going right to the technical definitions,

80
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,500
lets think about what happens. I might say that we were moving in one direction and

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,030
we moved 90 degrees or we moved into a second dimension or there's kind of a different type

82
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,290
of number, there is one number that goes
this way and one type that goes this way.

83
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,890
In your head, you want to
get your own understanding,

84
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,088
put it in your own words and
eventually you sharpen it up and

85
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:29,760
can I think a lot of times we
try to understand things just by

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,680
someone else's words instead of
really internalizing it ourselves.

87
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,570
>> Well, I, I think this is the perfect
example of the real imaginative world

88
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,040
of mathematics and science and
engineering, I mean,

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,140
we imagine things in ways that people
don't ordinarily imagine and, and

90
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,590
I love how you're approaching this,
because it really brings this to life.

91
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,380
But, you, what you do then you

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,590
move next on to an actual technical
description of what you were describing?

93
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,850
>> Yeah, that's right, so the last step is
follow me to use the formal notation that

94
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,360
came up with my little analogy here,
its kind of like you have a song in

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,780
your head you might be humming it, doo ta
dit da doo, but, humming in your head but,

96
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,580
other people don't really know
what you're talking about.

97
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,450
You need to find the sheet music,
you know,

98
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,140
explain, you know the scale
that you're using, and

99
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,030
the notation, the timing, that way
somebody else can really have a handle for

100
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,370
the hymn, instead of this little
song that's going in your head.

101
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,510
So you want to take,
you know, the rough words and

102
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,640
kind of break them down
in a formal notation.

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,930
In the math world,
the notation is "i",

104
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,840
lower case "I" and that actually
represents, the imaginary dimension and

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,760
it's kind of like the number one but
in just that imaginary dimension, It is in

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,140
there, now we can start talking about
other ideas in a more technical sense.

107
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,170
So when I say, oh I want to face
forward and to take two terms, and

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,700
I'll be facing negative,
what that means is you start with one,

109
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,390
multiply by i, multiply by i again,
and you should be facing negative.

110
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,497
Which should be is negative, so

111
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,720
a mathematician might write one
times i times i is negative one.

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,230
Now you can simplify this you could say,
oh, one times i squared equals negative

113
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,140
one, and you can simplify it further
by just saying i squared equals -1.

114
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,650
And then the last step,
is if you really want to simplify it,

115
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,590
you just take the square
root of both sides, and

116
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,900
now you can say that i equal
the square root of -1.

117
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,220
Now, this makes sense to us hopefully
now because we've been able to

118
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,830
walk through it step by step, and turn our
kind of intuitive fuzzy description into

119
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,180
the really technical one, and it's
really painful to start with a technical

120
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,120
description I equals the square root of
negative one, and try to guess what that

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,880
could've meant, and I promise you
don't see all the steps ahead of time.

122
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,610
So I realized to myself I really needed
to start at the fuzzy level, and

123
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,700
work my way down to technical.

124
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,860
>> Yes I, I think that's the thing about
imaginary numbers people often don't

125
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,690
realize that they can dance,
that they can twist and

126
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,410
rotate and that's kind of what they
do It's quite beautiful actually,

127
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,610
do you have final learning tips for
our viewers?"

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,460
.
.

129
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,011
>> Yea, I think the biggest
tip that I might say is just,

130
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,390
have a sense for
yourself when something's not clicking.

131
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,830
And realize that it's probably just
because of a missing piece. So you know,

132
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,930
in the past they might have just
reread the same passage again and

133
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,670
again because it wasn't working, but
maybe if you want to defer a diagram,

134
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,410
Google Images or
maybe a talk or a slideshow, or

135
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,340
something that might have a different
metaphor that can help you.

136
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,350
I realize, you know,
with the ADEPT you know,

137
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,750
analogy diagram example plain-English
technical, I need all the parts It's kind

138
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,630
of a part of a complete breakfast I
need all the different pieces, and

139
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,580
then when I have them,
I know the idea is very quick in my mind.

140
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,290
So, if I'm working on something and

141
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,560
it's just a technical, maybe an example,
it's usually not enough for

142
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,800
me to really internalize it, so
I start searching for the elements there,

143
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,950
I didn't even know that there were other
pieces that I should be looking for so for

144
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,880
me, it's kind of a, checklist that helps
me kind of zone in on what to do with it.

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,902
>> Great well, thank you so much I know
our viewers will benefit greatly from

146
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:10,768
these ideas, which I myself have
found really valuable thanks again.
