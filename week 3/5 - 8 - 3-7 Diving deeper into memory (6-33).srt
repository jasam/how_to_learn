00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,960
In this video and the next, we're going to
deepen our understanding of memory.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,530
As you're probably beginning to
understand, memory is only part

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,750
of learning and developing expertise but
it's often an important part.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,000
It may surprise you to learn that we have
outstanding visual and

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,670
spacial memory systems that can help form
part of our long-term memory.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,940
Here's what I mean.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,780
If you were asked to look around a house

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,430
you never visited before, you'd soon have
a sense

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,330
of the general furniture layout and where
the rooms

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,350
were, color scheme, the pharmaceuticals in
the bathroom cupboard.

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,250
In just a few minutes, your mind would

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,470
acquire and retain thousands of new pieces
of information.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,190
Even weeks later, you'd still hold far
more in your mind than

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,920
if you'd spent the same amount of time
staring at a blank wall.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,390
Your mind is built to retain this kind of
general information about a place.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,210
You can greatly enhance your ability to
remember if

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,540
you tap into these naturally super-sized,
visual, spacial memorization abilities.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,200
Our ancestors never needed a vast memory
for names or numbers

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,270
but they did need a memory for how to get
back home

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,670
from the three day deer hunt, or for the
location of those

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,420
plump blueberries on the rocky slopes to
the South of the camp.

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,450
These evolutionary needs helped lock in a
superior

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,500
"where things are" and "how they look" memory
system.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,450
To begin tapping into your visual memory
system try making a

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,890
very memorable visual image representing
one key item you want to remember.

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,030
For example, here's an image you could use
to remember Newton's second law.

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,880
F is equal to ma.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,450
This is a fundamental relationship
relating force to mass and acceleration.

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,790
And it only took humans, oh, a couple of
hundred thousand years to figure out.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,940
The letter f in the formula could stand
for flying, m

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,810
could stand for mule, and a, well that's
up to you.

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,640
Part of the reason an image is so
important to memory

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,480
is that images connect directly to your
right brain's visual spacial centers.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,570
The image helps you encapsulate a
seemingly humdrum and hard to remember

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,310
concept by tapping into visual areas with
enhanced memory abilities.

36
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,520
The more neural hooks you can build by
evoking the senses, the easier

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,390
it will be for you to recall the concept
and what it means.

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,470
Beyond merely seeing the mule, you can
smell the mule,

39
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,345
you can feel the same windy pressure the
mule is feeling.

40
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,475
[SOUND] You can even, hear the wind
whistling past.

41
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:57,740
The funnier and more evocative the images,
the better.

42
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,250
Focusing your attention brings something
into

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,140
your temporary working memory, but for
that

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,730
something to move from working memory to
long term memory two things should happen.

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,460
The idea should be memorable.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,610
There's a gigantic flying mule braying f
is equal to ma on my couch.

47
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,080
And it must be repeated.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,250
Otherwise remember your tiny metabolic
vampires, they can suck away

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,900
the neural pattern related to that memory
before it can strengthen and solidify.

50
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,620
Repetition's important.

51
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,710
Even when you make something memorable,
repetition helps

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,970
get that memorable item firmly lodged into
long-term memory.

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,770
Remember to repeat not a bunch of times

54
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,520
in one day but sporadically over several
days.

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Index cards can often be helpful.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Writing and saying what you're trying to
learn seems to enhance retention.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,700
For example, if you're trying to learn
concepts in physics you

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,830
might take an index card and write the
greek letter rho.

59
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,500
That's a common abbreviation for density.

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,950
You'd write it on one side and you'd write
the remaining information on the other.

61
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,917
Handwriting helps you to more deeply
encode, that is

62
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:21,950
convert into neural memory structures what
you are trying to learn.

63
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,430
While you're writing out the kilograms per
cubic

64
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,020
meter you might imagine a shadowy kilogram
just feel

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,720
that mass lurking in an oversize piece of
baggage

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,590
that happens to be one meter on each side.

67
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,450
The more you can turn what you're trying
to remember

68
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,640
into something memorable, the easier it
will be to recall.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,760
You'll want to say the word and its
meaning

70
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,520
aloud to start setting auditory hooks to
the material.

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Next, just look at the side of the card
with the Greek letter rho on

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,480
it, and see whether you can remember
what's on the other side of the card.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,510
If you can't, flip it over and remind
yourself what you're supposed to know.

74
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,650
If you can remember, put the card away.

75
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,400
Now, do something else.

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,040
Perhaps prepare another card and test
yourself on it.

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,380
Once you have several cards together, try
running through them all

78
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,930
and even mixing them around to see if you
can remember them.

79
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,600
This helps interleave your learning.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,090
Don't be surprised if you struggle a bit.

81
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,320
Once you've given your cards a good try,
put them away.

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,400
Wait and take them out again, maybe before
you go to sleep.

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,160
Remember that sleep is when your

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,460
mind repeats patterns and pieces together
solutions.

85
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,820
Briefly repeat what you want to remember
over several days.

86
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,120
Perhaps for a few minutes each morning or
each evening.

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,180
Gradually extend the time between the
repetitions

88
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,700
as the material firms itself into your
mind.

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,970
By increasing your spacing as you become
more certain

90
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,870
of mastery, you'll lock the material more
firmly into place.

91
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,330
Great flash card systems like Anki have
build in

92
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,500
algorithms that repeat in scale ranging
from days to months.

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,580
Interestingly, one of the best ways to

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,500
remember people's names, is to simply try
to

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,450
retrieve the people's names from memory at

96
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,080
increasing time intervals, after first
learning the name.

97
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,230
I'm Barbara Oakley.

98
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,556
Thanks for learning, about learning.

99
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:33,279
