2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:11,126
In this video, we're going to get into the
specifics of harnessing your zombie powers

3
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:16,240
of habit to help you avoid procrastination
while minimizing your use of willpower.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,890
You don't want to do a full scale change
of old habits.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,630
You just want to override parts of them
and develop a few new ones.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,300
The trick to overriding a habit is to
look to change your reaction to a cue.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,640
The only place you need to apply willpower
is to change your reaction to the cue.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,000
To understand that, it helps to go back
through the four

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,410
components of habit and re-analyze them
from the perspective of procrastination.

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,290
The first one is the cue.

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,010
Recognize what launches you in to your
zombie procrastination mode.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,240
Cues usually fall into one of the four
following categories.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,980
Location, time, how you feel and
reactions.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,660
Either to other people or to something
that just happened.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,710
Do you look something up on the web and
then find yourself web surfing?

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,350
Does a text message disturb your studying
taking you 10 minutes to get back

17
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,360
into the flow of things even when you try
to keep yourself on task?

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,240
The issue with procrastination is that
because it's an

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,560
automatic habit, you're often unaware that
you've begun to procrastinate.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,850
You can prevent the most damaging cues by shutting off your cell phone or

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,860
keeping yourself away from the internet
and

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,090
other distractions for brief periods of
time.

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,686
As when you're doing a pomodoro.

24
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:43,510
Number two, the routine.

25
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,580
Let's say then instead of doing your
studies

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,200
you often divert your attention to
something less painful.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,720
Your brain wants to automatically go into
this routine when you've gotten your cue.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,840
So this, is the reaction clue where you
must.

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,850
Actively focus on rewiring your old habit.

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,450
The key to rewiring is to have a plan.

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,330
Developing a new ritual can be helpful.

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,270
Some students make it a habit to leave
their phone in their

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,220
car when they head in for class which
removes a potent distraction.

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,070
Many students discovered the value of
settling into a

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,360
quiet spot in the library or closer to
home,

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,760
the productive effects of simply sitting in
a favorite

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,680
chair at the proper time with all Internet
access disconnected.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,160
Your plan may not work perfectly at first,
but just keep at it.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,250
Adjust the plan if necessary, and savor
those victories when your plan works.

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,380
Don't try to change everything at once. The
Pomodoro Technique

41
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,710
can be especially helpful in shifting your
reaction to the cues.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,720
Number three is the reward.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,840
This can sometimes require a little bit of
investigation.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,280
Why are you procrastinating?

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,290
Can you substitute an emotional payoff,
maybe a feeling of pride

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,620
for accomplishing something, even if it's
small, a sense of satisfaction?

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,900
Can you win a small internal bet or a
contest about something you've turned into

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,070
a personal game or allow yourself to
indulge in a latte or read a

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,330
favorite web site, provide yourself,
maybe, with

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,910
an evening of mindless television or web

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,420
surfing without guilt, and will you give

52
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,080
yourself a bigger reward for a bigger
achievement?

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Maybe movie tickets or a sweater or an
utterly frivolous purchase.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,230
Remember that habits are powerful because
they create neurological cravings.

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,420
It helps to add a new reward if you want
to overcome your previous cravings.

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Only once your brain starts expecting that
reward will the important

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,750
rewiring take place that will allow you to
create new habits.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,460
Many people find that setting a reward at
a specific time.

59
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,850
For example, breaking for lunch with a
friend at the

60
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,480
deli at noon or stopping the main task at
5 p.m.,

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,650
gives a solid, mini deadline that can help
spur work.

62
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,160
Don't feel bad if you find you have

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,640
trouble getting into a flow state at
first.

64
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,150
I sometimes find it takes a few days of
drudgery, through

65
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,620
a few cycles of the pomodoro technique
before flow begins to unfold.

66
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,730
And I find myself starting to enjoy
work on a new
topic.

67
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,980
Also remember that the better you get

68
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,950
at something, the more enjoyable it can
become.

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,120
Number four is the belief.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,420
The most important part of changing your
procrastination

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,530
habit is the belief that you can do it.

72
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,150
You may find that when the going gets
stressful.

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,460
You long to fall back into old, more
comfortable habits.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,100
Belief that your new system works is what
can get you through.

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Part of what can underpin is to develop a
new community.

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,623
Hang out with classmates, or virtually
hang out with MOOC-mates, who

77
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:17,070
may have that can-do philosophy that you
too want to develop.

78
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,160
Developing and encouraging culture with
like-minded friends can help

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,420
us remember the values that, in moments of
weakness.

80
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,590
We tend to forget.

81
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,815
I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning
how to learn.
