00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,360
Doctor Keith Devlin is a very big
guy in the world of math education,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,150
not to mention the world of math research.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,170
I'm introducing you to him here because
I love how he thinks about learning in

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,270
the world of mathematics, and
how his ideas about learning relate to

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,450
learning in all sorts of topics
way outside of mathematics.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,610
Among many other duties, Keith is
a Co-Founder and Executive Director of

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,250
Stanford's Human Sciences and
Technologies Advanced Research Institute,

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,110
a co-founder and president of
an educational technology company,

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,390
BrainQuake, that creates
mathematical learning video games.

10
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,150
He's also a World Economic Forum fellow,
a fellow of the American Association for

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,590
the Advancement of Science, and a fellow
of the American Mathematical Society.

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,218
Last, but definitely not least, he is
The Math Guy on National Public Radio.

13
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:01,210
Welcome, Dr. Devlin.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,920
Thanks for being with us here today,
Doctor Devlin.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,110
Let's just dive right in.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,860
What's the biggest tip you can
share with our viewers about how to

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,780
most effectively approach a math
problem that they might be stuck on?

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,590
Well the first thing,
of course, is don't panic.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,230
That's a famous Douglas Adams motto from
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,460
it holds just as much for mathematics as
it did, for, for The Hitchhiker's guide.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,890
You have to begin by understanding
what the problem's about.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,330
What are you trying to do?

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,670
What do you want to achieve?

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,350
And, what information do you have?

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,900
You must have, you,

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,260
I mean you've really gotta avoid the thing
that actually teachers try to impress on

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,270
you of trying to see if you can match
it to some template and to act quickly.

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,790
One of the worst things that I think
happens in the school system is people

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,010
come away thinking that solving math problems is
something that has to be done at speed.

30
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,440
It absolutely is not.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,770
So you have to sit back,
take a deep breath,

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,960
begin by understanding the problem.
If the problem involves numbers, put in

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,750
a few simple numbers, threes and fours and
just play with it to get a sense of it.

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,694
If it's a geometric problem,
do some little diagrams or

35
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:06,920
you, I often end up writing simple little
graph diagrams with dots and lines

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,080
connecting them, just some things to give
me a sense of what that problem's about.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,570
At that point, you can ask yourself,

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,630
do I know any techniques that look as
though they would work with this problem?

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,195
If they do, and you're in luck,
the problem's solved.

40
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,923
Actually that's usually very
unsatisfying because you've just

41
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:21,890
applied someone else's thinking.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,740
Mathematics gets interesting when your,
you have to force yourself to find a new,

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,790
a new method or some new approach.

44
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,480
So, lets assume that none of
the techniques you know work.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,350
The next thing is can I
adapt an existing technique.

46
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,830
Well, maybe you can, maybe you can't.

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,800
If you can that usually leaves you

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,810
with a nice feeling because
you've done something yourself.

49
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,316
The really challenging ones are the ones
where it gets actually exciting and

50
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:48,983
fun is where you, you it becomes clear at
least you think that nothing you know is

51
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,910
going to help you with that.

52
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,224
At that point, what you do is you, you,
you basically, you bash away at it

53
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:59,830
several times which just naive approaches
almost certainly they won't work.

54
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,290
You just try this and you try that.

55
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,040
You, you come up with ideas based
on what the problem's asking you

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,650
to do because solving
a problem is a journey.

57
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,080
You begin with the information you've got,

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,880
either the information your given with the
problem or information you already know.

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,030
You may have to add some extra
information, you may do a Google search,

60
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,900
find some extra information about it.

61
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,680
At that point, the journey takes place and

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,720
you have to get to the goal and
solve the problem.

63
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,300
If none of the methods you try for

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,740
the first oh, half hour, maybe depending
on the problem it could be half hour,

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,340
couple of hours,
sometimes it's a day or a few weeks.

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,820
But if nothing happens, then the best
thing to do is walk away from the problem,

67
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,850
go and do something else.

68
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,600
In my case, for

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,470
most of my career I was a long distance
runner, if I really came up against it.

70
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,410
I would put on my running gear, whatever
the weather and I'd go out for a three or

71
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,720
four hour run, and when I came back,
A, I felt good, I felt relaxed, and

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,010
quite often on the course of ride or
that, that, that run or

73
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,130
when I got back, the problem seemed
different and I had some new ideas.

74
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,790
As I got older my knees gave away
from 25 years of heavy duty running,

75
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,410
these days I ride a bicycle.

76
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,560
But I go on my bike and I go for
a three or four hour bike ride and

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,660
I come back, and first of all I can
approach the problem with a fresh eye and

78
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,850
secondly in some cases what seemed to be
an impassible problem just melted away.

79
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,440
I look at it and think oh, gee, that was
obvious, why didn't I see it before?

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,120
Well, I don't quite think that because I
know that the feeling you have when you

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,390
solve a problem is always oh, duh,
why didn't I think of that before.

82
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,390
And if that doesn't work
you start the cycle again.

83
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,180
You bash your way at it again, make no
progress and then you go, you go and

84
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,800
have another bike ride or a swim or
whatever it is you like to do.

85
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,410
A nice long walk.

86
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,150
But it's important to keep oscillating
between bashing away at it and

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,640
then backing off and doing something
else to let the brain do it's own thing.

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,570
I think that was one of
the hardest things for

89
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,960
me to realize was how
important it is to back away.

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,630
That sometimes, especially when it's
something difficult, it's as important to

91
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,600
be able to focus on it as it is to
be able to back away from it and

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,950
then come back later with a fresh
perspective and a fresh mind.

93
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,260
Okay, I, it, it, for,
for difficult problems,

94
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,120
I have never, ever solved a difficult
problem sitting at a desk or

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,950
even sitting in my chair,
thinking about the problem.

96
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,850
I've never done that, and
I'm not sure it's possible to do that.

97
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,240
Because if you think about it,

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,540
if a problem/solution requires something
new applying all of your conscious

99
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,870
thinking by definition can't solve it
because you're looking for something new.

100
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,920
The weird thing about the brain
is when you've done that

101
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,660
preparation of bashing away without
success and you go and do something else

102
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,300
I'll mention physical activity because I'm
a sort of a physical, active guy, although

103
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,090
the biggest result in my PhD was actually
when I was getting out of the bath.

104
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,050
I'd taken a long bath, you don't have
to sort of exert lots of energy,

105
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,340
you have to do something different.

106
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,330
Having a bath is a famous one among
mathematicians for solving problems.

107
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,940
But somehow weird stuff happens inside the
brain when you're doing something else and

108
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,920
what three hours ago seemed like
an impossible problem just melts away and

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,370
everything just falls into place.

110
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,000
The brain sorts it out when
it's left alone to do it.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,580
And that's exactly the kinds of ideas that
we're talking about in in our course.

112
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,910
It is important to do that initial work.

113
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,685
It's no good just going out for
a bike ride.

114
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:31,560
You've got to have gone through that
process of really coming up against it and

115
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,500
seeing everything that doesn't work, because
that seems to set up the mind in

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,300
order to do this mysterious stuff it does
when you're engaged in something else,

117
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,570
when your conscious mind is
engaged in something else.

118
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,580
Absolutely.

119
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,310
It, that's so important.

120
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,790
Well one thing that you've
described is that in

121
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,670
higher mathematics there should be a lot
less doing and a lot more thinking.

122
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,410
Can you tell our viewers what
you mean by that and how,

123
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,470
how does that relate to areas of
learning that are outside mathematics?

124
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,440
Yeah, and, and this is really
where you've got unlearn lots of

125
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,080
the things that you're taught at school.

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,410
And actually you're taught,
teachers do that for very good reasons,

127
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,450
because of the way we, especially in
the United States and parts of Europe,

128
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,470
the way we subject people to endless
test taking in, with timed tests.

129
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,170
The, the way to get through the school
system is to learn to act fast

130
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,190
under pressure of time, and

131
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,230
that's the last thing you can
do when it comes to mathematics.

132
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,450
You've really got to
let it take its course.

133
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,280
It's not,
I mean people have different speeds, I,

134
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,160
I've worked with some
very fast mathematicians.

135
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,550
The young math professor from Stanford
who won a Fields Medal recently.

136
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,770
She has gone on record as saying,
his teachers at school thought she

137
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,280
wasn't good at mathematics
because she was so slow.

138
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
Well, she may be slow, but she now has a,
the equivalent of a Nobel prize in

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
mathematics and, and
congratulations to her for doing that.

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,460
You really have to let it take its time.

141
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,895
It's a slow process.

142
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:58,394
You've got to remember that mathematics
is relatively recent, you know 2 or

143
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,030
3,000 years, so your bringing
what's essentially a stone age

144
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,490
brain to a domain that is
a couple thousand years old,

145
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,610
In fact, most mathematics
is only a few decades old.

146
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,320
So, how can you take this brain,
that evolved to survive in the wilds and

147
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,470
then more recently to survive
in social environments,

148
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,350
how can you take that brain and apply it to
solve this abstract problem in mathematics?

149
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,380
Well, the answer's we don't
really know how we do that.

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,760
What we do know is that if
you familiarize yourself with

151
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,710
the problem to such an extent that,

152
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,910
that problem is like a member of your
family, then the act of solving that math

153
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,560
problem is actually not unlike solving
a difficult problem you have at home.

154
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,280
You know, we're very good at
solving social problems and

155
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,400
problems about our environment,
because evolution set us up for that.

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,690
So, somehow we have to
figure out how to let

157
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,070
that brain solve that abstract
problem in mathematics.

158
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,680
And the act of getting
inside the problem and

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,890
thinking about it for
a long period of time, so that it's so

160
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,940
familiar, then the natural circuits in
the brain, that, that, that serve us

161
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,410
well all of the time actually come
into play for a math problem.

162
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,810
Now it, there's no proof of that,

163
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,240
but that's certainly my own
experience of what goes on.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,090
Yes.

165
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,550
Well, all I can say is,
three cheers for slow thinking.

166
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,190
And I love the idea of
thinking about math and, and

167
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,550
a difficult problem as being something
that's a member of your family.

168
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah, it's a, you know, it.

169
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,730
Math in many ways mathematics
problems are not, it's not,

170
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,610
they're not fundamentally different
from other problems except in one

171
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,770
respect they're about
totally abstract things.

172
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,130
So, someone solving their math
problems has an initial problem

173
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,400
that someone doesn't have if they're
solving their problem in real life or

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,320
a coaching problem in,
in sort of football.

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,410
Or, or, or, in a, you know, most of, I
used to spend a lot of time rock climbing,

176
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,520
and rock climbing is,
is partly physically, but

177
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,220
it's also a lot of problem solving
because you're having to look for

178
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,640
these moves, you're having to
move your body in the right way.

179
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,010
So there's an awful lot of problem
solving that we do all of the time,

180
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,350
and that's what the brain evolved to do.

181
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,070
And in the case of mathematics however,

182
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,220
the world in which you're solving those
problems isn't one we are familiar with.

183
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,860
You initially have to create that,
that world inside of you, and

184
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,715
this, I think, is why it's essential
to knock away at the problem for,

185
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:17,680
10-15 minutes a day, two days before
you let the brain do it's own thing.

186
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,820
My guess and my perception of what's
going on, is that, that process is

187
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,310
making my mind familiar with that demand,
with that problem to such an extent that,

188
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,940
that problem is just like
a problem I'd have with my family.

189
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,580
or, or, or my work place or whatever.

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,379
I've got all of this apparatus for solving
real world problems and social problems,

191
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,880
and once that math problem is inside my
mind, it's another problem just like that.

192
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,460
So, solving the math problem
usually isn't the hard part,

193
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,800
the hard part is getting that problem
familiar inside your mind, and the only

194
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,610
way to do that is just keep living in
the problem, get inside the problem.

195
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,200
Really live inside that problem for

196
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,670
ten minutes, half an hour,
maybe even a few days.

197
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,050
In the case of Andrew Wiles,

198
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,260
solving Fermat's Last Theorem a few
years ago, it took him seven years to

199
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,480
really get inside that problem to
the point where he could see the solution.

200
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,530
Well, part of what you do when you're
spending a lot of time with a problem is

201
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,640
you're in some sense reifying and
growing the neural structures,

202
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,060
that are related to what
you're trying to think about.

203
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,660
And one of the things that Dr. Sejnowski
and I emphasize, quite strongly in our

204
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,350
course is how exercise helps
actually build neural structures.

205
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,980
It, it allows you to learn better,
it allows you to remember better.

206
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,750
So, how, how does exercise play a role
in your own ability to do mathematics?

207
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,720
That's that's a good one.

208
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,100
But it certainly is the case for me.

209
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,010
In fact, when I was a PhD student and
my closest colleague was a, was a,

210
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,830
was a, a mathematician from
from the United States,

211
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,290
came over to England when I
was a student back in Bristol.

212
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,250
And he was a rock climber,
in fact I learned to rock climb with him.

213
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,440
And we used to go on these three or
four hour rock climbs.

214
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
And we would almost certainly,
by the time we got to the,

215
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,118
to the top of the climb we'd done some
mathematics, because you do a climb and

216
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:13,286
you get to a ledge and you're,
you're tied up and then you chat for

217
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,950
a while as you sort of
belayed onto the rock face.

218
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,380
And we'd talk about mathematics and
then we'd forget the mathematics and

219
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,450
we go and
do the physical stuff of climbing.

220
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,460
And when you're climbing, as when, as when
you're bicycling very fast your mind is

221
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,380
totally focused on that physical activity,
that's your your entire world is physical.

222
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,320
So, you're focused on the climbing or
you're focused on riding your bike, but

223
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,260
stuff is going on in
the background in your mind.

224
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,670
It's working on those things
that you talked about.

225
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,070
And we'd finish your pitch,
we'd get ourselves back on belay we

226
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,280
talk about the problem and
we've made progress on the problem.

227
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,920
So as a graduate student I
discovered this method of thinking,

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,170
doing, thinking,
doing was incredibly powerful.

229
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,850
I can make conjectures and,

230
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,650
and sort of self reflect as to why
the physical activity is important.

231
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,680
I mean aspects clearly are.

232
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,740
You're focusing on that activity.

233
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,350
It's very refreshing you know,

234
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,840
we tend to think these days that
the mind is separate from the body.

235
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,870
I don't buy that.

236
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,150
It certainly isn't the case for me.

237
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,530
I find that if my body's tired,
my mind is tired and

238
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,760
vice versa, they stimulate each other.

239
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,540
So, you know, the mind did evolve
to help the body survive, and

240
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,920
I think it's a mistake to try
to think of those as separate.

241
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,410
If you nurture the body the mind follows.

242
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,310
I, you know, this, this goes back to
the ideas of having physical education in

243
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,100
schools and so forth.

244
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,490
This is hardly original but
I think we need to take it seriously,

245
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,790
I've never ever,
well I have solved problems in the bath.

246
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,340
That's a, that's a,
a somewhat more relaxing case.

247
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,150
But even in the bath it's a really,
you know, it's a, it's a,

248
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,720
it's an artificial environment
in which you are relaxed.

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,930
You're in water, you're doing things,
you're fresh, you're freeing up the mind.

250
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,120
The mind is absolutely not
thinking about that problem.

251
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,820
It's doing other things in my
case definitely, the bath,

252
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,530
the bath example not withstanding,
physical activity plays a big role.

253
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,250
Exactly why I don't know,
but I do know it works.

254
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,030
[LAUGH] Well there is actually
good research evidence.

255
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,830
They're uncovering the,

256
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,580
the biophysiological mechanisms
by which it does take an effect.

257
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,610
but, I, I have to ask,
with everything that you do.

258
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,710
Do you ever catch yourself, it's hard to
believe but do you ever procrastinate, and

259
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,580
if you do,
what do you do to get yourself out of it?

260
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah well first of all I do do many things
you know, I've got my own educational

261
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,780
technology company, I do lots of biking I,
I run an institute at Stanford, I do my

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,200
teaching, I do, I'm actually on Twitter
a lot, I do a whole bunch of things.

263
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,150
You might think I'm a multitasker.

264
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,190
I absolutely do not multitask, not least
because I know from the research that's

265
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,960
been done here at Stanford,
a lot of it by my late colleague Cliff Nass,

266
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,310
that shows that, a) human beings
cannot multitask, and b) the more you

267
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,720
think you're good at multitasking,
the worse you are at doing it, so.

268
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,320
I absolutely don't try to use this
serial processor to multitask.

269
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,810
What I do is, I serial task.

270
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,150
I will work exclusively flat out for
periods of time.

271
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,530
Now they may only be ten minutes,
they may be half an hour, or they may be.

272
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,220
I mean, recently I had to develop
a whole set of 75 puzzles, a new set of

273
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,410
puzzles for, for my educational video
game that we launched last fall.

274
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,230
We wanted to bring out
a different version.

275
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,580
I worked nonstop on that for 4 days.

276
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,880
I didn't do anything else other than eat,
sleep, and bicycle ride.

277
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,390
And my entire focus, everything else went
to one side, was to get that thing done,

278
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,560
and four days later I had the 75 puzzles
worked and tested and everything.

279
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,130
And then I moved to something else.

280
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,080
So what I do is I work very intensely and
very focused for periods of time.

281
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,170
I mean, it's amazing that, that,
that friends and family are still by me,

282
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,370
because this is very focused and
it excludes everything else.

283
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,460
You know, I must be really difficult
to live with at those times, but

284
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,500
everything gets excluded.

285
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,280
I focus on it and then I,
there comes an end.

286
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,820
Now, either because I finished the job or
I just get tired and want to switch and,

287
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,520
and I'm really getting, getting
frustrated with it, then I'll switch and

288
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
do something else.

289
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,990
And what I've learned to do
very efficiently is switch from

290
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,570
one to the other.

291
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,080
It doesn't take me more than a few minutes
at most to switch from one to the other.

292
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,400
The procrastination comes from recognizing
that I need to make that switch.

293
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,590
I'll keep going and keep going and

294
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,600
think, I want to this other thing,
I want to do this other thing.

295
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,340
And I do find myself doing
lots of other little things.

296
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,800
I'll go and start and
read my Twitter feed and things for

297
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,190
a while before making the switch.

298
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,300
So, the one moment where I will
procrastinate is starting something new,

299
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,680
for obvious reasons.

300
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,250
You've been in the groove,
you've been making process and

301
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,110
it's slowed down and
you've got to get in another groove.

302
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,460
And I know that that takes will power and
effort, and like everybody else I do have

303
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,150
a procrastination streak, but the only
time it affects me is making that switch.

304
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,840
Once I've done it, I'm away in that domain
until I've either solved that issue or

305
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,640
done it or completed it or
got tired of it and need a break.

306
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,290
And that I found works extremely well.

307
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,990
That's, that's actually something
that we talk about in this course.

308
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,450
Is just that idea of you don't need
to use willpower all the time,

309
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,390
you just need to put it one little place,
wherever you need,

310
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,760
where you're getting that cue, that's
where you need to be applying will power,

311
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
and that seems to be exactly what you do.

312
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,820
And it's true that I'm fortunate to
have been able to carve out a career for

313
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,890
myself where most of the time,
I'm doing stuff I really want to do.

314
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,330
So even though I may not want to write
that blog post, I know in the back

315
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,240
of my mind that the moment I get into it
and have written the first sentences,

316
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,370
writing that blog post will be the most
important and most wonderful and

317
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,710
rewarding thing in the world
until it's finished.

318
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,520
But then I have to sort of stop that and
do something else.

319
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,170
And that's when these hiatus moments when,
when, I procrastinate.

320
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,320
It's the, the, the switching gears
to something else that's, that's,

321
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,670
that I find.

322
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,730
I won't say I find it difficult,

323
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,990
because I've been doing it all my life,
but you do need willpower to do that.

324
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,370
At least I find I need
willpower to do that.

325
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,450
And if I'm not careful,

326
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,970
it will just fritter away with
social media or whatever.

327
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,060
I feel the same way in
how I handle things.

328
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,590
One thing I, I like to do is I
think of it, my life as like this

329
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,400
enormous funnel where there's all these
things that are demanding to be done, but

330
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,770
then only one thing can go
through the funnel at a time.

331
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,440
And so you just gotta give it up and

332
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,370
realize one thing is all
you can be focusing on.

333
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,090
And if you have that approach it makes it

334
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,630
a little easier to realize that
you just can't do everything.

335
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,640
You just do as much as you reasonably can.

336
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,930
Yeah, I mean, one thing I do do is when I
actually just upgraded my computer system.

337
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,100
to a new Macintosh.

338
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,140
The first thing I did is went into
the into the system controls and

339
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,360
switched off every single alert.

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,220
I don't want visual alerts, I don't
want noise alerts, I don't want know if

341
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,820
an email has come, I don't want
to know if something's going on.

342
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,020
I literally switch off all the alerts
because I don't want things pushed to me.

343
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,440
I want to go and find out things when I
need them, because the last thing I want,

344
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,110
if I'm in the middle of working on
an article say, is to have some little,

345
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,900
little beep going off to tell
me some email has arrived.

346
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,030
I don't want to know then
because that's a distraction.

347
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,620
I want to be in the world of
writing that article because if you

348
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,480
take this human brain, and you put it
into a problem, into a domain, and

349
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,320
you set it free, it loves what it's doing,
and it doesn't want to give up,

350
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,680
and it sure doesn't want to be distracted.

351
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,830
And so, I don't distract it.

352
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,080
I just let it do what it does.

353
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,260
Well, I, I,

354
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,870
I thank you so much, Doctor Devlin for
sharing your wisdom with us, here today.

355
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,770
It's just been a great
pleasure talking to with you,

356
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,320
and I know our viewers will really, really
learn a lot from what you had to say.

357
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay, the pleasure's been all mine,
absolutely.

358
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,260
Thanks, so much.
