00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:07,645
Learning well often involves bit by bit,

3
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:11,700
day by day building of solid neural
scaffolds.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,870
Rather like a weight lifter builds muscle
with day to day exercise.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,150
This is why tackling procrastination is so
incredibly important.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,790
You want to keep up with your learning and
avoid last minute cramming.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,110
So with that, here's an overview of the
key aspects of tackling procrastination.

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,310
Keep a planner journal so you can easily
track when

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,450
you reach your goals and observe what does
and doesn't work.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,960
Commit yourself to certain routines and
tasks each day.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,090
Write your planned tasks out the night
before so your brain

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,920
has time to dwell on your goals and help
ensure success.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,780
Arrange your work into a series of small
challenges.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,800
Always make sure you, and your zombies,
get lots of rewards.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,130
Take a few minutes to savor the feelings
of happiness and

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,650
triumph, which also gives your brain a
chance to temporarily change modes.

17
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,170
Deliberately delay rewards until you've
finished a task.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,130
Watch for procrastination cues.

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,810
Try putting yourself in new surroundings
with few procrastination

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,120
cues, such as the quiet section of a
library.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,250
Gain trust in your new system.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,245
You want to work hard during times of

23
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:28,980
focused concentration and also to trust
your system enough

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,810
so that when it comes time to relax,

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,590
you actually relax without feelings of
guilt or worry.

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,200
Have back up plans for when you still
procrastinate.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,620
No ones perfect after all.

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,750
Eat your frogs first every day.

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,078
Happy experimenting.

31
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:50,220
Thanks for learning, how to learn.
