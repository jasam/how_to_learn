2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:09,621
Learning for most people involves a
complex balancing of many different tasks.

3
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:11,919
A good way for you to keep perspective

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,182
about what you're trying to learn and
accomplish,

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:20,490
is to once a week write a brief weekly
list of key tasks in a planner journal.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,120
Then each day on another page of your
planner journal, write a

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,600
list of the tasks that you can reasonably
work on or accomplish.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,190
Try to write this daily task list the
evening before.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,080
Why the evening before?

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,570
Research has shown that this helps your
subconscious to grapple with the

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,500
tasks on the list so you can figure out
how to accomplish them.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,790
Writing the list before you go to sleep,
enlists your zombies,

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,910
to help you accomplish the items on the
list the next day.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,432
If you don't write your tasks down on a
list, they lurk at the edge

15
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:55,997
of the four or so slots of your

16
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:59,780
working memory, taking up valuable mental
real estate.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,860
But once you make a task list, it frees
working memory for problem solving.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,890
So let's look at one of my daily task
lists.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,910
As you can see here, there are only six
items.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,790
Some are process oriented.

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,630
For example, I have a paper due to a
journal in several months.

22
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:22,150
So, I spend a little focus time on most
days working towards completing it.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,100
A few items are product oriented.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,690
But that is only because they are doable
within a limited period of time.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,170
Note my reminders.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,510
I wanted to keep my focus on each item
when I'm working on it.

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,630
And I want to have fun.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,990
I did catch myself getting sidetracked,
because I forgot to shut down my email.

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,830
To get myself back into gear, I set a 22

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,310
minute Pomodoro challenge, using a timer
on my computer desktop.

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,950
Why 22 minutes?

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,870
Well, why not?

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,610
I, I don't have to do the same thing each
time.

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,330
And notice, too, that by moving to

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,740
Pomodoro mode, I've switched to a process
orientation.

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,300
None of the items on my list is too big,

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,980
because I've got other things going on in
my day.

38
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,640
Meetings to go to, a lecture to give.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,350
Sometimes I sprinkle a few tasks that
involve physical

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,140
motion on my list, even if it's just
cleaning something.

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,980
Which, I'll admit, isn't ordinarily one of
my favorite things to do.

42
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,680
Somehow because I'm using them as diffuse
mode breaks, I often look forward to them.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Mixing other tasks up with your learning
seems to make everything

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,210
more enjoyable and keeps you from
prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting.

45
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,180
Over time, as I've gained more experience,
I've gotten much better

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,540
at gauging how long it takes to do any
given task.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
You'll find yourself improving quickly as
you become more realistic

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,790
about what you can reasonably do in any
given time.

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,460
Make notes in your planner journal about
what works and what doesn't.

50
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,640
Notice my goal finish time for the day, 5
p.m.

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,810
Doesn't seem quite right, does it?

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,620
But it is right, and it's one of

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,580
the most important components of your
daily planner journal.

54
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,758
Planning your quitting time is as
important as planning your working time.

55
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:17,610
Generally, I aim to quit at 5 p.m.,

56
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,130
although when I'm learning something new,
it can sometimes be a pleasure to

57
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,460
look at it again after I've taken an
evening break, just before I

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,300
go to sleep, and occasionally, there's a
major project that I'm wrapping up,

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,020
like say, this MOOC that has me running
into a bit of overtime.

60
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,850
You might think, well, yeah, you know, but
you're a

61
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,550
professor who's shall we say, past your
youthful study days.

62
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,770
Of course an early quitting time is fine
for you.

63
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,190
However, one of my most admired study
experts, Cal Newport, used the 5 p.m.,

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,280
quitting time through most of his student
career.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,310
He ended up getting his PhD from MIT.

66
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,230
In other words, this method, implausible
though it may seem for some, can

67
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,970
work for undergraduate and graduate
students in rigorous academic programs.

68
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,410
Time after time, those who are committed
to maintaining healthy leisure time along

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,510
with their hard work, outperform those who
doggedly pursue an endless treadmill.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,200
Of course, your life may not lend itself

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,230
to such a schedule with breaks and leisure
time.

72
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,740
You may be running on fumes with two jobs
and too many classes.

73
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,960
But however your life is going, try to
squeeze a little break time in.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,890
One more thing.

75
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,540
As writing coach Daphne Graygrant
recommends to her

76
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,700
writing clients, eat your frogs first in
the morning.

77
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,040
Try to work on a most important and most
disliked task first.

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,280
At least just one Pomodoro, as soon as you
wake up.

79
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,500
This is incredibly effective.

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,420
Do you need to sometimes make changes in
your plans because of unforeseen events?

81
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,200
Of course, but remember the law of
serendipity.

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,190
Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

83
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,930
Planning well is part of trying.

84
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,230
Keep your eye on your learning goal, and

85
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,960
try not to get too unsettled by
occasional roadblocks.

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
I'm Barbara Oakley.

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,587
Thanks for learning how to learn.
