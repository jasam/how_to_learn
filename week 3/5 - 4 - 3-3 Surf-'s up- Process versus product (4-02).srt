00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:08,188
One of the best ways of being effective in
your learning

3
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:12,530
is to use mental tools and tricks to
inspire and motivate yourself.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,990
First, when it comes to learning in
general, you should realize that it's

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,030
perfectly normal to start with a few

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,030
negative feelings about beginning a
learning session.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,030
Even when it's a subject you ordinary
like,

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,700
it's how you handle those feelings that
matters.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,790
Researchers have found that
nonprocrastinators put their

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,880
negative thinking aside saying things to
themselves like.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,120
Quit wasting time and just get on with it,

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,780
once you get going, you'll feel better
about it.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,530
If you find yourself avoiding certain
tasks because they make you

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,010
feel uncomfortable, you should know
there's

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,730
another helpful way to re-frame things.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,080
And that's to learn to focus on process
not product.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Process means, the flow of time and the

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,380
habits and actions associated with that
flow of time.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,920
As in, I'm going to spend 20 minutes
working.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,970
Product is an outcome, for example, a

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,320
homework assignment that you need to
finish.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,810
To prevent procrastination you want to
avoid concentrating on product.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,920
Instead, your attention should be on
building processes.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,370
Processes relate to simple habits, habits
that coincidentally allow you

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,680
to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be
done.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,100
For example, lets say you don't like doing
homework in a particular class.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,700
So you put off working on the homework.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,080
It's only five questions you think.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,900
How hard could that be?

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,615
Deep down, you realize that answering
these

31
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,700
five questions could be a very lengthy
job.

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,230
It's easier to live in a fantasy world
where the five questions, or

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,920
the ten page report or whatever, can be
done at the last minute.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,160
You're challenge is to avoid focusing on
the product, the answers to the questions.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,370
The product is what triggers the pain that
causes you to procrastinate.

36
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,730
Instead, you need to focus on the process
or processes.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,980
The small chunks of time you need over
days or

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,040
even weeks to answer the questions or
prepare for tests.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,740
Who cares whether you finish the homework
or

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,560
grasp the key concepts in any one session.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,760
The whole point instead, is that you
calmly

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,590
put forth your best effort for a short
period.

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,350
Now process.

44
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,860
Notice how in this picture physicist and

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,030
surfer Garret Lacy is focused on the
moment.

46
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,730
Not on the accomplishment of having surfed
that wave.

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,565
For you, one of the easiest ways to focus
on process is to focus on doing a

48
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:54,520
Pomodoro, a 25 minute timed work
session, not on completing a task.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,440
The essential idea here is that the zombie
habitual part

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,640
of your brain likes processes because it
can march mindlessly along.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,020
It's far easier to enlist the friendly
zombie habit to

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,960
help with a process, then to help with a
product.

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,520
By focusing on process rather than
product, you allow yourself to

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,730
back away from judging yourself, am I
getting closer to finishing?

55
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,840
And instead you allow yourself to relax
into the flow of the work.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,060
The key is when a distraction arises, which
it inevitably will,

57
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,530
you want to train yourself to just let it flow
by.

58
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,510
Of course, setting yourself up so that
distractions

59
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,480
are minimal is also a very good idea.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,810
Many students find that either a quiet
space or noise canceling headphones

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,370
if, if you can afford them, can be helpful
when they're really trying to concentrate.

62
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,449
I'm Barbara Oakley.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,847
Thanks for learning above learning.
