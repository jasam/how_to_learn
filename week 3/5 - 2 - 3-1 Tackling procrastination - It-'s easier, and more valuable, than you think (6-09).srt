1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,950
Arsenic is incredibly toxic.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,150
For centuries until modern methods of
detection were discovered

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,090
murderers found it to be a very popular
substance.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,810
So you can imagine the shock at the 48th

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,380
meeting of the German Association of Arts
and Sciences.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:31,350
In 1875 when two men sat in the front of
the audience and downed more than double

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,900
a deadly dose of arsenic. The next day the

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,520
men were back at the conference smiling
and healthy.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,990
How is it possible to take something so
bad for you and stay alive, and even

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,650
look healthy, despite the damage being
done at a microscopic level to your body?

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,710
The answer has an uncanny relationship

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,100
To procrastination that's what we're going
to

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,030
be talking about in the next few videos.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,360
You've already learned one handy tool

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,240
to help you with procrastination the
pomedoral

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,390
that 25 minute period of uninterrupted
focus followed by a bit of relaxation.

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,720
This week we're going to learn more.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,700
Understanding a little about the cognitive
psychology of procrastination, just like

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,540
understanding the chemistry of poison, can
help us develop healthy preventatives.

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,210
In these videos, I'm going to teach

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,030
you the lazy person's approach to tackling
procrastination.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,420
This means you'll be learning about your
inner zombies.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,030
The routine, habitual responses your brain
falls into as a result of specific cues.

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,340
These zombie responses are often focused
on making the here and now better.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,320
As you'll see you can trick some of these
zombies

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,950
into helping you fend off procrastination
when you need to.

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,570
Not all procrastination is bad.

28
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,090
Even if you're pretty good already in
handling procrastination you'll learn some

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,670
helpful insights here tha can allow you to
better prioritize your learning.

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,330
The reason that learning to avoid
procrastination is so important

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,210
is that good learning is a bit by bit
activity.

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,090
You want to avoid cramming which doesn't
build solid neural structures.

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,130
By putting the same amount of time into
your learning

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,210
but spacing that learning out by starting
earlier you'll learn better.

35
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,870
First things first.

36
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,640
Unlike procrastination which is easy to
fall into, willpower is hard to come by.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,810
It uses a lot of neural resources.

38
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,260
You shouldn't waste willpower on fending

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,190
off procrastination except when absolutely
necessary.

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,990
Best of all as you'll see you don't need
to.

41
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,810
If you'll remember we procrastinate about
things

42
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,990
that make us a little bit uncomfortable.

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,270
You think about something you don't
particularly

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,390
like and the pain centers of your brain

45
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,930
light up so you shift and narrow

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,140
your focus of attention to something more
enjoyable.

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,460
This causes you to feel better.

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,080
At least temporarily but sadly the long

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,810
term effects of habitual avoidance can be
nasty.

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,780
When you put off your studies it can

51
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,380
become even more painful to think about
studying it.

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,990
You can choke on tests because you haven't
laid the firm neural foundations you need.

53
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,620
To feel comfortable with the material.

54
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,960
Procrastination can be a single
monumentally important keystone bad habit,

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,850
a habit in other words that influences
many important areas of your life.

56
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,920
If you improve your abilities in this area

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,200
many other positive changes will gradually
begin to unfold.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,470
Procrastination shares features with
addiction.

59
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,810
It offers temporary excitement and relief
from sometimes boring reality.

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,970
It's easy to fool yourself for example
into thinking

61
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,480
that the best use of any given moment is.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,560
Surfing the web for information instead of
actually

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,880
reading the textbook or doing the assigned
problems.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,040
You start to tell yourself stories.

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,180
For example you might tell yourself that
organic chemistry requires spacial

66
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,610
reasoning, your weakness, so of course
you're doing very poorly at it.

67
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,330
You devise irrational excuses that sound
superficially reasonable like if I

68
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,350
study too far ahead of the test I'll
forget the material.

69
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,520
If you're troubled by procrastination you
may even start

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,970
telling yourself that procrastination is
an innate unchangeable characteristic.

71
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,220
After all if procrastination were easily
fixable wouldn't you have fixed it by now?

72
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,570
The higher you go in your studies however
the

73
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,840
more important it is to take control of
procrastination.

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,200
Habits that worked in earlier years can
turn around and bite you.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,170
What I'll show you in these next few
videos is how you can become.

76
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,640
The master of your habit.

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,030
You should be making the decisions not

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,020
your well-meaning but unthinking zombies,
your habits.

79
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,320
As you'll see the strategies for dealing
with procrastination are simple.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,840
It's just that sometimes they aren't
intuitively obvious.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,130
So let's return to that story that began
this video.

82
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,450
The arsenic eaters started with tiny doses
of arsenic.

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,210
In tiny doses, arsenic doesn't seem
harmful.

84
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,340
You can even build up an immunity to its
effects.

85
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,560
This can allow you to take larger doses
and look

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,660
healthy, even as the poison is slowly
increasing your risk of

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,420
cancer and ravaging your organs.

88
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,980
In a similar way procrastinators put off
just that one little thing.

89
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,490
They do it again and again gradually
growing used to it.

90
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,990
They can even look healthy but the long
term effects? Not so good.

91
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,010
I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how
to learn.
