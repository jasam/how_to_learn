00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,830
Welcome back to Learning How to Learn.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,670
What would it be like if you couldn't
learn new things, you would not

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,850
be able to remember new people you met,
or remember what you were told?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,820
This actually happened to a famous
patient in the annals of memory

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,379
research whose initials were HM.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,270
At the age of 27, HM had an operation for

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,160
epilepsy that took out his hippocampus
on both sides of his brain.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,040
The hippocampus has a shape of a seahorse
and is named from the Greek hippos,

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,840
meaning horse and kampos,
meaning sea monster.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,680
The operation was a success.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,080
The epilepsy was cured but
the price was steep.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,500
HM could no longer remember new things.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,110
He had become profoundly amnesic.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,560
Curiously, you could have a normal
conversation with HM, but if you left

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,530
the room for a few minutes, he could not
remember you or what you had discussed.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,480
In the film Memento,

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,720
the character played by Guy Pearce had
this form of amnesia from a concussion.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,440
Note that he tattooed his
body with messages, so

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,280
that he would not forget
what he had to do.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,770
HM could learn other things,

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,940
like a new motor skill, but
he could not remember having learned it.

22
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,530
There are multiple memory systems for
different types of learning.

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,460
From the studying HM and
animals with similar operations,

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,250
we have learned that the hippocampus
is important part of a brain system for

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,040
learning and memory of facts and events.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,830
Without the hippocampus and its inputs, it
is not possible to store new memories in

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,530
the cortex, a process called memory
consolidation that can take many years.

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,210
HM could remember things
from his childhood but

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,820
he had trouble remembering things that
had occurred in the years just before his

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,940
operation, things that had not yet
become fully consolidated.

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,160
Something similar happens when
you have a bad concussion but

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,989
this usually resolves,
unlike HM who never improved.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,440
Memories are not fixed but

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,880
living, breathing parts of your brain
that are changing all of the time.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,630
Whenever you recall a memory, it changes,
a process called, reconsolidation.

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,260
It is even possible to
implant false memories,

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,710
which are indistinguishable from
real ones by simply suggesting and

38
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,970
imagining, especially in children
who have vivid imaginations.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,940
Here is a summary.

40
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,690
The green process of consolidation takes
the brain state in active memory and

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,110
stores it in long term memory by modifying
synapses on the dendrites of neurons.

42
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,730
These long term memories can remain
dormant for a long time until the memory

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,480
is retrieved and reinstated, by the red
process, in short term working memory.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,590
The reinstated memory is in a new context,
which can itself be transferred to

45
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,120
long term memory, thereby, altering
the old memory though reconsolidation.

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,870
Our memories are intertwined
with each other.

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,790
As we learn new things,
our old memories also change.

48
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,720
Like consolidation,
reconsolidation also occurs during sleep.

49
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,880
This is why it is more effective
to space learning over time,

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,220
rather than mass learning all at once.

51
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,610
If you want to study something for
an hour, you will retain it longer if

52
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,320
you spend 10 minutes each month over
a semester than an hour on one day.

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,980
In contrast, if you wait until the day
before an exam to cram the material,

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,210
you may be able to retrieve for

55
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,920
the next day on the exam but
it will quickly fade from memory.

56
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,860
In addition to neurons,

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,220
brains have several types of
supporting cells called glial cells.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,685
The astrocyte is the most abundant
glial cell in the human brain.

59
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:55,500
Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons,

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,990
maintain extra cellular ion balance, and
are involved with repair following injury.

61
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,660
In this photo of the cortex,
the astrocytes are staying green and

62
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,890
the neurons are blue.

63
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,630
The intricate arms of the astrocytes
wrap around the neurons,

64
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,919
each embracing thousands of synapses.

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,060
A recent experiment suggest
that these astrocytes may

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,750
also have an important role in learning.

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,910
When human astrocytes were put into mouse
brains, the humanized mice learned faster.

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
Interestingly, when Einstein's brain was
examined to find out what made him so

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
awesomely creative,
the only difference that could be

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,280
found was that he had many more
astrocytes than the average human.

71
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,670
Could astrocytes be the key to
understanding human intelligence.

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,350
Well, the more we learn about the brain,
the more may we have to rethink learning.

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,830
I'm Terry Sejnowski.

74
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,482
Happy learning, until we meet again.
