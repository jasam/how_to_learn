2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,220
Just imagine backing out of a driveway for
the first time ever in your life.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,520
For some of you, that might seem like a
pretty exciting proposition.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,980
The first time you might do this you would
be in hyper alert.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,280
The deluge of information coming at you

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,970
would make the job seem almost impossibly
difficult.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,350
But, once you've chunked how to back up
down your

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,950
driveway, all you have to do is think,
let's go.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,080
And, off you go.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,240
Your brain goes into this sort of zombie
mode, where it is only semi

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,190
aware of a few key factors, instead of
being overwhelmed by all the data.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,100
It's the same idea with riding a bicycle.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,715
At first, it's really hard, later it's
easy.

14
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:56,200
Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is
related to habit.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,900
Habit is an energy saver for us.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,250
It allows us to free our mind for other
types of activities.

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,610
You go into this habitual zombie mode far
more often than you might think.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,530
That's the point of habit, you don't have
to think in

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,310
a focused manner about what your doing
while you're performing the habit.

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,240
It saves energy.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,310
Habits can be good and bad.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,840
They can be brief, like absently brushing
back your hair.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,180
Or they can be long, for example when you
take a walk,

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,680
or watch television for a few hours after
you get home from work.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,470
You can think of habits as having four
parts.

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,720
The first is the cue.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,550
This is the trigger that launches you into
zombie mode.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,860
The cue may be something as simple as
seeing the first item in your to do list.

29
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,110
Time to start next week's homework.

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,830
Or seeing a text message from a friend.

31
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,790
Time to stop work.

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,590
A cue by itself is neither helpful or
harmful, it's the routine.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,860
What we do in reaction to that cue, that's
what matters.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,230
Number 2, the routine.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,440
This is your zombie mode.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,480
The routine habitual response your brain
is used

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,370
to falling into when it receives the cue.

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,230
Zombie responses can be useful, harmless,
or sometimes harmful.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,200
Number 3, the reward.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,070
Every habit develops and continues because
it rewards us.

41
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,905
It gives us an immediate little feeling of
pleasure.

42
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:34,640
Procrastination's an easy habit to develop
because the reward, moving your

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,900
mind's focus to something more pleasant,
happens so quickly and easily.

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,880
But good habits can also be rewarded.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,526
Finding ways to reward good study habits
is important for escaping procrastination.

46
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:52,290
Number 4, the belief.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,850
Habits have power because of your belief
in them.

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,870
For example, you might feel you'll never
be able to change

49
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,230
your habits of putting off your studies
until late in the day.

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,130
To change a habit, you'll need to change
your underlying belief.

51
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,130
