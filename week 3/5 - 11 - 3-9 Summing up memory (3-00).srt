2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:06,760
Learning to use your memory in a

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,009
more disciplined yet creative manner helps
you

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,792
learn to focus your attention, even as you

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:17,490
create wild diffuse connections that build
stronger memories.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,390
Here are the key ideas about memory we've
covered.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,540
In this course, we discussed two main
memory

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,220
systems involved in your ability to chunk
concepts.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,150
The first is long term memory, which is
like a storage warehouse.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,020
You need to practice and repeat in order
to help store items

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,280
in long term memory so you can retrieve
them more easily.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,320
Practicing and repeating, all in one day,
is a bad idea.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,970
You want to extend your practice to
several days.

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,420
This is why tackling procrastination is
important.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,580
It helps you build better memories.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,660
Because you start earlier.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,480
The second, is working memory, which is
like a poor blackboard that quickly fades.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
You can only hold about four items in your
working memory.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,610
When you master a technique or concept in
some sense, it compacts the ideas so

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,880
they can occupy less space in your working
memory when you do bring them to mind.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,870
This frees your mental thinking space so
that

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,360
it can more easily grapple with other
ideas.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,230
We have outstanding visual and spatial
memory systems.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,090
If you tap into those systems, it will
help improve your memory.

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,720
To begin tapping into your visual memory
system, try making a

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,010
very memorable visual image representing
one key item you want to remember.

27
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,260
Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,490
and even to smell something you're trying
to remember.

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,360
The funnier and more evocative the image
is, the better.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,990
As always, repetition over several days is
really helpful.

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,040
Another key to memorization is to

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,060
create meaningful groups that simplify the
material.

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,140
Try associating numbers with years or with

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,530
systems you're familiar with like running
times.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,970
Many disciplines use memorable sentences.

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,780
The memory palace technique, placing
memorable images in a

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,580
scene that's familiar to you, allows you
to dip into

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,960
the strength of your visual memory system,
providing a

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,580
particularly powerful way of grouping
things you want to remember.

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,940
By making meaningful groups and
abbreviations,

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,120
you can simplify and chunk what

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,160
you're trying to learn so you can more
easily store it in memory.

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,220
And by memorizing material you understand,
you

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,080
can internalize the material in a profound
way.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,350
You're reinforcing the mental library you
need

46
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,130
to become a genuine master of the
material.

47
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,840
Happy memories. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks
for learning how to learn.
