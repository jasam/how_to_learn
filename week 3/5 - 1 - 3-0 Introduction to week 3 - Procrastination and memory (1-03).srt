00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,910
This week we're going to be talking about
two seemingly different ideas.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,550
Procrastination and memory.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,490
But the two topics are intimately related.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,130
Why?

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,620
Because building solid chunks of long term
memory, chunks that

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,870
are easily accessible by your short term
memory, takes time.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,810
It's not the kind of thing you want to be
putting off until the last minute.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,480
You already have one good tool for
procrastination.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,450
The pomodoro.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,730
That powerful 25 minute concentrated
period of energized focus.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,950
This week we're going to fill you in with
more

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,160
information about how procrastination
happens and simple ways to tackle it.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,570
And this is key.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,570
Ways that don't take much will power, then
we'll move on to talking about some of the

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,890
best ways to access your brain's most
powerful long-term memory systems.

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,370
I'm Barbara Oakley.

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,080
Thanks for learning how to learn.
