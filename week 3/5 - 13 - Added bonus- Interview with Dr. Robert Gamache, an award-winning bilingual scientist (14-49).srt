1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,560
>> Dr. Robert Gamache was named by

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,460
Thomson Reuters as one of the world's most
influential scientific minds for 2014.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,080
He's also currently the Associate Vice
President of

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,450
Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and
International Relations at the

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,960
University of Massachusetts, while
simultaneously serving as a professor

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,126
in the Department of Environmental Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences.

7
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:32,980
Despite Dr. Gamache's long experiences in
administrator, he

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,610
was also the dean of the University of
Massachusetts

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,462
School of Marine Sciences for close to a
decade,

10
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:43,300
Dr. Gamache is also clearly a very active
researcher.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,310
Of the list of the ten most cited

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,300
publications by the University of
Massachusetts Lowell faculty

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,770
compiled in 2011, he was a coauthor on

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,480
five of the ten, including the top three
papers.

15
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:02,980
Dr. Gamache's current work relates to the
problem of line shapes from molecules.

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,730
Ultimately, this work is important in
understanding planetary atmospheres.

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,600
In support of missions for NASA and the
European Space agency.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,920
Professor Gamache is married to Suzanne
and

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,680
has two children, Justine and Peter, and a

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,986
very clever dog, Newton, who helps
professor

21
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:25,140
Gamache to explain Newton's laws to his
classes.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,335
With that, let's begin our questions.

23
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:31,070
Dr. Gamache, I'm so glad to have you here.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,570
And let's start with our first question,

25
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,270
which is you're bilingual in French and
English.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,210
Can you talk a little bit about that
bilingual background and how

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,800
it might inform your learning in both the
sciences and, and overall?

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,670
>> Sure.

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,320
There are a few interesting points of my
study of French.

30
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,880
I've had the opportunity to work in France
often,

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
and early on I decided I would learn the
language.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,250
I was in my late 30s at the time.

33
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:08,840
[COUGH] First, let me say that I'm
dyslexic and as a child I had.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,570
Really a lot of trouble learning English,
spelling, grammar, reading.

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,000
I still have trouble reading.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,770
I'm a little bit slower than most people,

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,470
especially with the precision needed for
reading scientific articles.

38
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,100
But my study of French really enforced my
learning of English.

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,629
And I'm really grateful for, for that.

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,280
In terms of learning, I use a bilingual as
an

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,060
example of why students should study every
subject every day.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,040
When I say this to students I of, often
get a very strange looks.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,580
And I explain that no, I'm not saying
study for six hours out of class every day

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,210
but, you should do the homework that's
needed

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,740
and spend at least 15 minutes on every
subject.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,460
And I use being bilingual as an example.

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,470
When I go to France, my first couple of
days I struggle to find words.

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,610
After a few days, it's kind of smooth.

49
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,640
What's interesting is when I come back to
the United States, my

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,780
first few days in the United States, I do
the same thing.

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,710
I'll have a colleague or a student come in
my office and ask me a question.

52
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,850
And my mind is just racing, looking for
the English word.

53
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,910
Thank goodness after a few days it's, it's
okay.

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,340
So, why is it we can speak English without
thinking?

55
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,540
And, you know, the answer is that we're
using it all the time.

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,950
So it's just there in our brain.

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,050
So the example I used for them is if you

58
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,950
study chemistry every day, you, it's right
there in your brain.

59
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,280
You don't have to search for things.

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,210
The same thing with work with physics,

61
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,180
or biology, or psychology, or history, any
subject.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,860
If you study it every day, it's just there
in your

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,360
brain and you don't have to do a lot to
recall information.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,100
It's just there.

65
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,840
>> You know, sometimes I think of it as
like strumming a guitar.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,390
After you strum it, it resonates and it
continues to, to resonate and send out

67
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,500
the sound, and I almost think that that's
what we're doing with our own brains

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,930
when we're just keeping something in mind,
we're keeping those neurons resonating a

69
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:25,380
little bit so they don't sort of die away
and, and go off to do other things.

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,780
So, I, I think that's a vitally important
piece of advice.

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,970
You observe that when you first began
studying in

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,910
the Sciences, you stumbled across some
particularly effective techniques.

73
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,080
Can you tell us a little bit about those
techniques?

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,520
>> sure.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,790
I mean, the correct word here is stumbled.

76
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,810
Because when I was an undergraduate, there
was not a lot of research on how

77
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,010
we learn, and the things I did, I just
stumbled upon them.

78
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,060
Now they are backed by research, and you,
you show a number

79
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,790
of these things in your book and I can
attest that they work.

80
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,010
So when I was an undergraduate I was

81
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,630
taking physical chemistry in my third year
and I

82
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,570
became fascinated with the fact that you
could

83
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,320
take equations, you could take simple
rules of physics.

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,620
And with that, you could derive other
equations.

85
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,590
And what I did is I started doing every
problem in the textbook.

86
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,180
At first, it was a little difficult but
with time, I

87
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,390
could do problems as fast as I could look
at them.

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,620
So, I noticed that problem solving in

89
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,750
other courses at the same time became
easier.

90
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,050
It was later in graduate school that I
found that

91
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,680
there was research and this repetition
actually hard-wires your brain.

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,516
So in my case, I hardwired my brain to
solve problems.

93
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,512
>> Precisely.

94
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:56,050
I, I think it's almost like again, like
learning an instrument.

95
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,040
By practicing continuously, you can bring
those,

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,490
those parts of a melody to mind instantly,
and, and play them

97
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,760
and fit them together in new ways more
easily,

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,980
and that can be a very effective technique
for learning.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,650
Can you talk a little bit about how

100
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,730
some of these techniques which you applied
in science?

101
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,930
Also can be useful in the Humanities and
the Social Sciences?

102
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,658
>> Well, yes they are.

103
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,010
And, you know, the interesting point is,
while I was doing

104
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,460
this and I was hard wiring my brain to
solve problems.

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,060
And I mention problem solving in other
disciplines became easier.

106
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,120
So it does spill over and, you now, this
technique is, is not unique to science.

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,070
This, this would work with any subject
matter that you would like to study.

108
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,990
So I, I do recommend this for my science
students and also for the non-scientists.

109
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,150
It's a great strategy to develop to, to
get knowledge in a certain area.

110
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,020
And again, one of the big benefits is it
spills over to your other studies.

111
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,230
>> Exactly.

112
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,030
I think it's very similar to the kinds

113
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,585
of techniques I used when I was learning
Russian.

114
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:19,730
I, I tried to do a lot of the additional
practice exercises so that I could stretch

115
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,020
my brain a little bit and become much

116
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,630
more comfortable with the things that we
were learning.

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,210
Let me ask you this now.

118
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,100
What kinds of techniques did you develop
to handle matters when

119
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,870
you found yourself getting stuck in
problem solving in your studies?

120
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:43,470
>> Again, I have to say my discovery was
serendipitous.

121
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,480
When I started at UMass Lowell, I was
entering a new field.

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,360
And the, the early, early stages of that
meant I had a lot of studying to do.

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,010
So, I would come home from a full day at

124
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,060
work, and I would immediately sit down at
my desk.

125
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,250
And start studying some more.

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,920
And often I would get stuck on, on

127
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,290
concepts or stuck on problems then I had
to

128
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,160
take a break for dinner or a few times I
had friends come over just to say hello.

129
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,460
And what I found was while eating dinner
and conversation,

130
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,380
suddenly the answer would just pop up in
my mind.

131
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,730
And at the time, I would run off and write
it down

132
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,720
like I was going to lose it if I didn't do
it immediately.

133
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,270
But the gears are always turning in
the background.

134
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,040
My wife used to joke that I had two
brains.

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,310
Now when I get stuck, I deliberately take
a

136
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,830
break and try to do something just to
relax, you

137
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,420
know, almost thoughtless, it can be as
simply as bouncing

138
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,040
a tennis ball off the wall or something
like that.

139
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,480
After five to ten minutes, I tend to go
back to the problem with the answer.

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,140
And sometimes, I have to sleep on it.

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,600
There are many mornings when I wake up and
suddenly, I have the answer in my brain.

142
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,220
>> Isn't that funny and, and that kind of

143
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,750
technique is so useful for so many
different areas.

144
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,470
One thing, I love that you mention your
family on your website.

145
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,420
It's clear your family is very important
to you.

146
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,350
How do you balance your family life and
your work life?

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,240
>> Well, that balance has always been
important to me.

148
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,440
I tell my students and my post-docs that
as a

149
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,130
scientist involved in research, you're a
little like a professional athlete.

150
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,340
Every day you have to get up, and do
something that's

151
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,380
going to make you a little bit better than
the competition.

152
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,980
Young faculty members at research
universities

153
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,240
live by the mantra publish or perish.

154
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,740
However, this, you know, this is
tremendous pressure.

155
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,900
But, if you're working all the time it
tends not to be productive.

156
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,630
And as I just explained that downtime can
be very beneficial.

157
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,270
The gears are always turning.

158
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,160
So being with my wife, playing with my
children, or

159
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,350
playing with my dogs has, has always given
me a chance

160
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,560
to relax my mind to refresh my mind so
that

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,819
when I do go back to work, I can be
productive.

162
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,380
>> Has this balance shifted from your early
student days?

163
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,953
Do you, do you have any particular advice
for

164
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,490
students who are at various stages in
their life's careers?

165
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,190
>> Well, the shift from the early days to now has
been noticeable.

166
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,130
When I was in graduate school, I was in
two programs at the same time.

167
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,650
So I was basically a study machine.

168
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,460
And that down time with my wife and my
daughter, also

169
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,240
playing ice hockey in the winter, tennis
in the summer time.

170
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,190
That gave me a chance to, I used to say,
you know, get the steam out.

171
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,150
It, it refreshed me enough where I could
go

172
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,820
back, and the time that I spent was
productive.

173
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,050
Now I work as hard but, you know,

174
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,480
I have experience so things that, things
happen faster.

175
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,890
But, I do realize that the down time is
important, and now I actively seek it out.

176
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,180
My advice to students has been, you know,
choose

177
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,730
a career that you can do something that
you love.

178
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,930
When you love something, it's always
easier to learn.

179
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,220
I've been really lucky in my 36 plus years
here at

180
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,580
UMass, where, you know, I can't remember a
single bad day.

181
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,030
And I'm sure I probably had one, but I
can't remember it.

182
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,010
So, you know, the key point is do
something you love, work hard at it.

183
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,320
But it's important to have that down time.

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,500
That down time keeps you refreshed and you
don't have to worry.

185
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,720
The gears will turn in the background.

186
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,820
But working all the time you get burnt out
and you

187
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,300
just can't accomplish what you can when
you refresh yourself periodically.

188
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,600
>> Well, I think that's just fabulous
advice.

189
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,740
And one thing I, I agree heartily with is
do something you love, but also

190
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,030
realize that sometimes it takes a little
longer to learn to love certain subjects.

191
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,800
So sometimes it's good to be patient too.

192
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,610
I do have a last question for you.

193
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,550
How does your dog Newton help your
students to learn more effectively?

194
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,780
>> Well, I use Newton and my previous
dogs to lighten up the classroom.

195
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,120
A picture of Newton, you know, watching a
tennis ball fall.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,000
I was actually going to do a video where I
dropped

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,280
an apple on his head, but my wife wouldn't
let me.

198
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,100
I also have a picture that I use of a
previous

199
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,560
dog, Chaos, who was a 96 pound Irish Wolf
Hound mix.

200
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,870
Sitting at a table with an Advanced
Atmospheric Dynamics book open.

201
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,980
He's got glasses on, and he's punching
numbers into a calculator.

202
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,700
And then I say to my students, you know,
see, Physics

203
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,870
or science is so easy even a dog can do
it.

204
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,340
Of course, the next step is to choose

205
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,450
examples that can give students a real
feel

206
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,550
for the subject, and let them realize how

207
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,790
simple Physics, or science in general, can
be.

208
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,290
And, and that's the real art of being a
professor.

209
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,410
Choosing these examples that, that make it
easy.

210
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,870
We have to remember, we're not born

211
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,250
and that includes us, knowing these
disciplines.

212
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,440
science, or any other course.

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,100
so, you know, when, when we're doing this
work we, we, we

214
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,500
have to lighten it up, but we have to
choose these examples.

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,440
Science is compounded by the fact

216
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,890
that people are very uncomfortable with
numbers.

217
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,680
I use an example where I, I pass tennis
balls around the class.

218
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,120
So the student can see, and feel, hold the
ball, then I ask

219
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,430
them, what size box could hold 10 732 balls
being in the United States?

220
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,003
I get the answer in feet, and I make it a
cube, so it's easy, easy for

221
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,860
them to give me one number and, you

222
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,080
know, I get numbers in the hundreds of
thousands.

223
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Seldom, do I get a number that's below a
hundred.

224
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,515
You want to guess what the answer is?

225
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,270
>> [LAUGH] No, you go for it.

226
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,810
>> It's four, it's four feet.

227
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,950
And when I say that, you know, that just

228
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,370
drives home the point that we really don't
know numbers.

229
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,490
So, using examples in the classroom where

230
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,580
they can really latch onto it is
important.

231
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,980
Because that's what helps drive deep
learning.

232
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,110
>> That is, really the ultimate example of
the

233
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,590
kinds things that we're talking about in
this course.

234
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,001
So Dr. Gamache, I cannot tell you how much
I

235
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,141
appreciate your taking the time to be with
us here today.

236
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:41,080
And thank you so very much.

237
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,310
>> You're very welcome.

238
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,770
Thank you.
