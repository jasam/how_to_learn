1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,060
In this video, we're going to delve deeper
into memory.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,890
Another key to memorization is to

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,100
create meaningful groups that simplify the
material.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,630
Let's say you wanted to remember four
plants that help ward off vampires.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,330
Garlic, rose, hawthorn and mustard.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,400
The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so
all you need to

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
do to remember is use the image of a
graham cracker.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,790
It's much easier to remember numbers by
associating them with memorable events.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,230
The year 1965 might be when one of your
relatives was born for example.

10
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,318
Or you can associate numbers with a
numerical system you're familiar with.

11
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:56,490
For example, 11.0 seconds is a good
running time for the 100 meter dash.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,970
Or 75 might be the number of stitches on

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,030
a knitting needle for the ski hats you like
to make.

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,820
Personally, I like to associate numbers
with the feelings of,

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,000
when was I was or will be at a given age.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,180
The number 18 is an easy one.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,990
That's the age when I went out into the
world.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,680
By age 104 I hope to be an old, but happy
great grandma.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,970
Many disciplines use memorable sentences
to help students memorize concepts.

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,950
The first letter of each word in the
sentence is also the

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,120
first letter of each word in a list that
needs to be memorized.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,670
Medicine, for example, is laden with
memorable mnemonics.

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,880
Among the cleaner of which are: some
lovers try

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,150
positions that they can't handle to
memorize the names

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,480
of the carpal bones of the hand, and old

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,140
people from Texas eat spiders for the
cranial bones.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,480
Time after time, these kinds of memory
tricks prove helpful.

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,470
If you're memorizing something commonly
used, see whether someone has come

29
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,750
up with a particularly memorable memory
trick by searching it out online.

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,360
Otherwise try coming up with your own.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,650
The memory palace technique is a
particularly powerful

32
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,920
way of grouping things you want to
remember.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,140
It involves calling to mind a familiar
place.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,260
Like the layout of your house, and using
it as a sort of a

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,620
visual notepad where you can deposit the
concept images that you want to remember.

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,560
All you have to do is call to mind the
place you're familiar with.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,650
Your home, your route to school, or your
favorite

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,090
restaurant and voila in the blink of an
imaginative eye.

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,146
This becomes the memory palace that you'll
use as your notepad.

40
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:46,490
The memory palace technique is useful for

41
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,310
remembering unrelated items, such as a
grocery list.

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,280
Milk, bread, eggs.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,330
To use the technique, you might imagine a

44
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,920
gigantic bottle of milk just inside your
front door.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,900
The bread plopped on the couch and a
cracked

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,370
egg dribbling off the edge of the coffee
table.

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,920
In other words, you'd imagine yourself
walking through a place you

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,200
know well, coupled with shockingly
memorable

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,550
images of what you want to remember.

50
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,180
If you're studying Finance, Sociology,
Chemistry or what have you, and

51
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,390
you have lists to remember, you could use
this same approach.

52
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,740
The first time you do this, it will be
slow.

53
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,970
It takes a bit of time to conjure up a
solid mental image.

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,740
But the more you do it, the quicker it
becomes.

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,370
One study showed that a person using the
Memory Palace technique could remember

56
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,510
more than 95% of a 40 to 50 item list after only one or two practice mental

57
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,020
walks, where the items were placed on the
grounds of the local university.

58
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,670
In using the mind this way, memorization
can become an outstanding exercise in

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,900
creativity that simultaneously build
neural hooks for even more creativity.

60
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,220
Purists might sniff that using

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,258
oddball memorization gimmicks isn't really
learning.

62
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,720
But researchers show that students who use

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,790
this kind of tricks outperform does who
don't.

64
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,020
In addition, imaging research
on

65
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,150
how people become experts, shows that such

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:27,218
memory tools speed up the acquisition of
both chunks and big picture templates.

67
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:31,440
Helping transform novices to semi experts
much

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,710
more quickly, even in a matter of weeks.

69
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,480
Memory tricks allow people to expand their
working

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,220
memory with easy access to long term
memory.

71
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,370
What's more, the memory process itself
becomes an exercise in creativity.

72
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,380
The more you memorize using these

73
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,970
innovative techniques, the more creative
you become.

74
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,530
This is because you're building these
wild,

75
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,410
unexpected possibilities for future
connections early on.

76
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,570
Even as you're first internalizing the
ideas, the more you practice this type

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,100
of memory muscle so to speak, the more
easily you'll be able to remember.

78
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,750
Where at first it may take 15 minutes to
build

79
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,580
an evocative image for an equation and
embed it say,

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,710
in the kitchen sink of your memory palace,
it can

81
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,180
later take only minutes or seconds to
perform a similar task.

82
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,440
You'll also realize that as you begin to
internalize key aspects of the material.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,380
Taking a little time to commit the most
important points to memory.

84
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,430
You come to understand it much more
deeply.

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,460
The formulas will mean far more to you,
than they

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,720
would if you simply looked them up in a
book.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,180
And you'll be able to sling those
formulas around

88
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,070
much more proficiently on tests and in
real world applications.

89
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,180
You may say, well, you're just not

90
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,420
that creative, an equation or theory could
hardly

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,910
have its own grandiose motivations or
persnickeity emotional

92
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,400
needs to help you understand and remember
it.

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,340
But always remember, your childlike
creativity is still there inside you.

94
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,680
You just need to reach out to it.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,580
I'm Barbara Oakley.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,179
Thanks for learning how to learn.
