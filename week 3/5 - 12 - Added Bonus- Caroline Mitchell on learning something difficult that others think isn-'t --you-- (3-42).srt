00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,420
Hi everyone, I'm Caroline.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,570
I live in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,650
And I grew up in Miami, Florida
where I was always good at reading.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,110
I liked art, philosophy, stuff like that.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,070
I was the girl in elementary school who

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,465
got in trouble for
reading behind the desk in math class.

7
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:30,560
[LAUGH] And a little bit later in
high school I got in trouble for

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,281
skipping math altogether
to go the beach instead.

9
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:40,890
[LAUGH] I have two older sisters
one of them became a doctor,

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,980
the other became a lawyer.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,550
So I had a lot to live, live up to.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,920
And my parents thought their youngest
child who was kind of a free spirit,

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,438
math and science hating kid
would end up with a degree

14
00:00:56,438 --> 00:01:02,730
in creative poetry,
cartoon drawing, or something.

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,980
But to everyone's surprise,

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,990
I chose mechanical engineering
as my major at Auburn.

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,500
And that was kind of weird
because it combined all of

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,400
the subjects that I was worst at.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,360
And people always, now, and

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,950
in school, they always ask me
why I would choose that major?

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,330
And Dr. Oakley promotes this
idea of broadening your

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,970
passions instead of just following them,
which I think is just an incredible idea.

23
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,270
And it perfectly describes what I
was feeling going into this field.

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,900
I knew that I was always going to
have a passion for English and

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,910
art and
all the things that I've always loved.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,140
But now, I have these new passions for
engines and power tools and

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,888
coding, and
stuff I never even knew that I liked.

28
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:06,750
[LAUGH] And that's really cool.

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,260
It's cool to find interest
that you never knew you had.

30
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,160
School was really hard for me.

31
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,428
A lot of my peers had
worked in auto shops and

32
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:24,820
they were certified machinists and
all sorts of technical brains.

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,420
And, so it was really hard for

34
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,106
me to keep up because I had never
even changed my own oil before.

35
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:39,580
[LAUGH] But I worked my butt off for
four years and I got through.

36
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,590
And it really paid off,

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,658
because upon graduation I got this amazing
job with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics.

38
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:54,020
And I work with some of the most
advanced technology and

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,530
coolest military aircraft
in the whole world.

40
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,980
And I feel like I'm valued at my job

41
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,130
just as much for
my problem solving skills and

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,370
my engineering skills that I learned
in school, as my creativity and

43
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,368
my communication skills,
my writing skills, my people skills.

44
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:21,950
And it's good to feel
proud of yourself for

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,010
stuff that you were naturally born with.

46
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,690
But it's also really cool to feel
proud of yourself for working

47
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,647
really hard to learn how to do something
that you weren't actually good at.

48
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:39,280
So that's kind of why
I went into my field.

49
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,310
So thanks guys.

50
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,810
Good luck.
