[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:05,924
Yep, that's me when I was 10.

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:11,040
I loved animals, handicrafts, and
dreaming.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,540
Back then, I was the belligerent queen of
anti-math.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,350
I neglected, ignored, flunked, and
downright hated math and

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,800
science all through grade school, middle
school, and high school.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,467
It's strange to realize I'm now a
professor of Engineering.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,830
I enlisted in the army right out of high

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,780
school to study language at the Defense
Language Institute.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,560
That's me at 18, looking very nervous

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,610
and very focused while throwing a hand
grenade.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,890
I only started to study math and science
when I

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,490
was 26 years old, after I got out of the
military.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,820
At first, it was really hard.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,720
There were all these quick thinkers in my
classes who

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,310
seemed to get everything a lot easier and
faster than me.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,060
Sometimes I'd take a break for a few
months, I'd

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,720
go out and work as a Russian translator on
Soviet trawlers.

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,480
That's me up in the Bering Sea.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,820
And I'd come back to school and try and
learn some more.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,160
As I gained technical know-how, new doors
started opening up for me.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,340
I ended up working as a radio operator at
the South Pole Station in Antarctica.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,980
That's where I met my husband.

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,860
I always say I had to go the end of the
Earth to meet that man.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,070
Here he is, after only 10 minutes outside

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,970
at minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit with a
60-mile-an-hour wind.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,489
The wind chill takes it off the charts.

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,820
Now, I wasn't natural in math and science.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,190
Not at all.

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,090
The way I succeeded was to gradually begin
to figure out some tricks.

31
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,360
But let's back up a step.

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,640
In the greater scheme of all the different
careers and disciplines that people

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,140
can pursue, why are those involving math

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,370
and science, sometimes, a bit more
challenging?

35
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,300
We think it may be related, at least in
part, to the abstract nature of the ideas.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,720
I mean, let's take a cow for example, out
standing in a field.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,040
If you have the word cow, you can point

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,970
right to a cow to learn what that word
means.

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,050
Even the letters for the word cow, C-O-W,

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,300
are roughly analogous to sounds that they
stand for.

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,140
But for mathematical ideas, there's often
no analogous thing that you can point to.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,740
There are no plus signs standing out in a
field.

43
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,020
No multiplication, division, or other
kinds of things that

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,487
can directly equate to mini mathematical
or scientific terms.

45
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:54,610
These terms are more abstract, in other
words.

46
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,760
Well, you might say, yeah, but what about
ones like love, zest, or hope?

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,070
Those are all abstract.

48
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,620
Yes they are, but the thing is, these

49
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,640
abstract terms are often related to our
emotions.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,370
We can feel our emotions, even if we can't
see

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,080
and point to concrete examples, like we
could with the cow.

52
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,860
This means it's important to practice with
ideas and concepts your

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,630
learning in math and science, just like
anything else your learning.

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,240
to help enhance and strengthen the neural

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,820
connection your making during the learning
process.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,780
You can see on your left here the symbolic
representation of a thought pattern.

57
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,470
Neurons become linked together through
repeated use.

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,750
The more abstract something is, the more
important it is to

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,640
practice in order to bring those ideas
into reality for you.

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,000
Even if the ideas you're dealing with are
abstract, the

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,400
neural thought patterns you are creating
are real and concrete.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,870
At least they are if you build and
strengthen them through practice.

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,885
Here's a way to picture what's going on.

64
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:14,250
When you first begin to understand
something, for example, how to

65
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,630
solve a problem, the neural pattern from
is there, but very weak.

66
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:25,880
Kind of like the faint pattern at the top
of our paintball machine analogy here.

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,960
When you solve the problem again fresh

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,640
from the start, without looking at the
solution.

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,380
You, if you begin deepening that neuron
pattern, kind of

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,940
like the darker pattern you see here in
the middle.

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,590
And when you have the problem down cold,
so you can go over

72
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,420
each step completely and concisely in your
mind without even looking at the solution,

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,620
and you've even had practice on related
problems, why then, the pattern

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,480
is like this dark firm pattern you can see
towards the bottom of the pinball frame.

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,550
Practice makes permanent.

76
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,050
When you're learning, what you want to do
is study something.

77
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,270
Study it hard by focusing intently.

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,430
Then take a break or at least change your
focus to something different for awhile.

79
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,430
During this time of seeming relaxation,
your brain's diffuse mode has a chance to

80
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,080
work away in the background and help you
out with your conceptual understanding.

81
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Your, your neural mortar in some sense has
a chance to dry.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,620
If you don't do this, if instead you learn
by cramming, your knowledge base will

83
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,840
look more like this, all in a jumble with
everything confused, a poor foundation.

84
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,100
If you have problems with procrastination,
that's when

85
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,560
you want to use the Pomodoro, that brief
timer.

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
This helps you get going, using brief
periods

87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,410
each day of focused attention, that will
help

88
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,980
you start building the neural patterns you
need

89
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,550
to be more successful in learning more
challenging materials.

90
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,920
Next stop, we'll be talking about
chunking, the vital

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,260
essence of how you grasp and master key
ideas.

92
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,529
I'm Barbara Oakley.
