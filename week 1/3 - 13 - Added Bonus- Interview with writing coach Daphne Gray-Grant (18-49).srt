1
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:07,060
Daphne Gray-Grant grew up
in the newspaper business.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,650
Her father owned a struggling
weekly paper in Vancouver, Canada.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,910
While going to highschool and

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,020
college she worked there until she
graduated and for a few more years.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,050
Then she became a senior editor at a large
metropolitan daily where she worked for

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,650
about eight years.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,100
Following that she became
pregnant with triplets and

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,510
decided she still didn't
have nearly enough work.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,938
She wanted to be self employed so,
the Publication Coach was born.

10
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:40,450
Interestingly Daphne says that she
struggled with writers block during all of

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,920
her years of newspapering and

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,550
didn't address the problem until
she started her own business.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,162
She's also the author of the popular book,
Eight and

14
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,716
a Half Steps to Writing Faster, Better.

15
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:55,494
Through her website,
www.publicationcoach.com she

16
00:00:55,494 --> 00:01:00,090
offers the weekly newsletter,
Power Writing.

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,290
It's weekly, brief, and
best of all, it's free.

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,040
I've been a subscriber for years myself
and I encourage you to sign up as well.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,550
Meanwhile, it's my great pleasure
to welcome Daphne here today.

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,400
Daphne you're a professional
writing coach.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,910
Tell me about your own past
struggles with writer's block.

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,412
Well, you know, the interesting thing for
me is that I struggled enormously with

23
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:31,206
writing, even when I was a professional
reporter at a daily newspaper.

24
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:32,423
Now you might think,

25
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:36,620
how can someone who works at a daily
newspaper have writer's block?

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,540
Didn't you have to write every day?

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,340
But the thing is, I was a born editor, and

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,250
when I worked in newspapers, I did a
little bit of writing and mostly editing.

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,590
And I loved editing.

30
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,020
I've always loved editing and

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,940
the few times when I had to write when
I worked for the daily newspaper.

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,480
I found it very stressful and
extremely difficult.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,280
Partly I guess because I was an editor and

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,000
so I was a little bit embarrassed
about how slow a writer I was.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,027
But also because I hadn't
really learned the tricks and

36
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:15,608
techniques I've since learned to make
writing faster, easier and better.

37
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:18,880
>> Well, I think we'll be talking
about some of those tricks.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,000
And one of the ways I think that
we might talk about that is just,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,390
how did you teach your triplets to write.

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,687
Did you use some of those tricks?

41
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:33,650
>> [LAUGH] Well, you know,
I taught my triplets to do many things,

42
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,640
they're 20 years old now, and
they're all at university which is great.

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,900
They're so different you'd barely know
they were siblings, nevermind triplets.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't know whether it would be fair
to say I taught them to write, but

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,970
I certainly gave them
some of the tricks and

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,420
techniques I give my own clients, and
they too have found them very helpful.

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,260
>> Well, let's hone in on one of those tricks.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,820
I mean, how would you describe
the difference between diffuse mode and

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,080
focused mode when you're thinking
about and when it comes to writing?

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,370
>> Yeah, that's, that's a really,
really important point because, for

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,630
me the diffuse mode I call that
the creative or writing mode.

52
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,192
And the focus mode I
call the editing brain.

53
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,900
And what, one of the big mistakes
that many people make when they're

54
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,400
writing is they try to write
with their editing brain.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,640
And the metaphor I like to use is I say,
imagine that these two different

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,920
parts of your brain are like two different
people, and now put them in a car.

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,310
What do you know about that?

58
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,672
Only one person can drive.

59
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,713
So if you're critical or

60
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:55,240
focused brain is driving your diffused
brain is asleep in the back seat.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,350
And that's not what anyone
wants when they're writing.

62
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,630
You want your diffused
brain to be active and

63
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,230
awake, to be the one that's
driving when you're writing.

64
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,100
And so one of the techniques I like to

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,562
use to help people engage their
diffused brain is mind mapping.

66
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,700
Now the important thing
about mind mapping is

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,630
its a little bit different
from concept mapping and I

68
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,020
don't know too much about concept mapping
because I'm not am academic myself.

69
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,930
But mind mapping, which is also
called clustering, some people may

70
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,830
know it by that name instead,
is where you take a piece of paper and

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,230
you turn it sideways and
that's really, really important.

72
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,200
Having the paper sideways is essential
because what that does is that kind of

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,870
liberates your brain.

74
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,970
And it says oh,
I can go off in any direction.

75
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,420
If you, if you have the paper in
the sort of standard 8.5 by 111 way,

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,600
that going to make your brain think you
need to write a list or worse, an outline.

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,950
And I really encourage students, in
particular, not to outline before writing.

78
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,340
And I know this flies in the face of
what many Grade 10 English teachers will

79
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,810
counsel you to do but the thing is,
if you think about it,

80
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,340
outlining engages your focused brain.

81
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,360
That's the part of the brain that's good
at spelling and grammar and alphabetical

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,020
order and sort of very specific tasks and
when you're writing, you want to create.

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,490
You want to think of things.

84
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,790
You want to make new connections.

85
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,490
And that's where you really
need the diffused brain.

86
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,110
So to mind map take that piece of paper,
turn it sideways and

87
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,040
write the topic in the center of the page.

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,900
Then draw a circle around it.

89
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,930
And once you've drawn
that circle around it,

90
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,280
then just write whatever
springs into your brain.

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,290
The thing I also like to say, and people
find this a little bit gross sometimes,

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,155
but I say its kind of like
vomiting onto the page.

93
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:02,250
[LAUGH] So.

94
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,371
Don't criticize yourself,

95
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:10,299
don't second guess any of those ideas
that occurs to brain then write it down.

96
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,609
So I did a mind map some years ago and

97
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:16,377
I use this when I'm teaching
mind mapping all the time.

98
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,979
And I did it on the first day of school.

99
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,810
I, I don't mean I wrote the mind
map on the first day of school.

100
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,640
I wrote the mind map about
the first day of school.

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,040
So what I wrote in the center of
the page was first day of school.

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,290
And part of the reason I picked
this topic was because it

103
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,410
breaks very neatly into some
obvious marking points.

104
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,940
So one is grade one,
one is high school, one is university.

105
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,970
So you can have different first days
of school tied to those events.

106
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,270
So then I wrote those down and

107
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,820
you'll see I've marked them
with little cross hatches.

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,710
I did that after the fact just so

109
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,140
that when you look at the mind
map you can see this easily.

110
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,860
And then if you look you'll see next to

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,360
the one I've marked grade one
in the top right hand corner.

112
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,810
I've written the words bee sting.

113
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,720
Now what does a bee sting have to
do with a first day of grade one?

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,330
Well, when I went to grade one,
first day of school I'm standing

115
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,170
in the school yard with my mother and
I got stung on the lip by a bee.

116
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,420
I will never ever forget that moment.

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,450
For me first day of school will
always be linked with being stung by

118
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,730
a bee right there on the lip.

119
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,630
So all I have to write is two words,
bee sting.

120
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,480
And everything comes back to me.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,410
I can picture the spot, the exact spot
in the playground where I was standing.

122
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,749
I can remember the crabby old
nun who came up to me and

123
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,115
said what are you making such a big
deal about because I was crying.

124
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:53,160
You know, so

125
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,870
its almost like a movie I can play in my
own brain just based on those two words.

126
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,660
Now one of the questions I often get when
I talk about this is people say well,

127
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,770
I can see how mind mapping
would be very useful for

128
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,460
fiction and I can see how it
might even be useful for memoire.

129
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,850
But what does it have
to do with non fiction?

130
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,570
And I have to say that I use mind
mapping everyday of my writing life and

131
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,790
I have never written any fiction.

132
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,630
Ever.

133
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,650
So I use it entirely for non fiction.

134
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,800
And what you can do is when
you interview someone and

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
you take your notes,
then you put the notes aside and

136
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,348
you do the mind map based on
your memory of that interview.

137
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:45,170
And the things that are most interesting,
I guarantee your brain will remember.

138
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,410
Now, for university students,
the issue's going to be a bit different

139
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,910
because you're, it's less likely you're
gong to be interviewing a bunch of people.

140
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,580
It's more likely you're going to
be reading a bunch of books, but

141
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,800
the same principle applies.

142
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,960
If there is something that is really
interesting to you and important and

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,970
integral to your research,
you're likely to remember that.

144
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,330
And the things that are most important
are going to float to the top of

145
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,290
your memory.

146
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,630
So you will remember them and
then you can mind map about them.

147
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,380
>> Well, this is very interesting because
it's related to the techniques that

148
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,610
brilliant Nobel Prize winning
neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal

149
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,020
used when he was trying to

150
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,670
really understand what was going
on at an anatomical level.

151
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,250
He would look very carefully at the cells
he was watching in his microscope, and

152
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,900
then we would turn and
he would try to draw them, and

153
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,390
and he would draw and re-draw.

154
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,900
Until he, he had abstracted
the key chunks that stuck in

155
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,550
his memory from when he was
looking at them with the camera,

156
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,680
with the microscope, versus when he
was trying to draw them on the page.

157
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,490
So in some sense, it seems what
you're doing is, is to try and

158
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,500
abstract the key ideas that
have somehow crystalized in

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,470
your mind through using
the mind mapping technique.

160
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,580
>> That, that's a really,
really good way of putting it.

161
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,480
Yeah, and, and, you know,
it's, it interests me.

162
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,980
In terms of education these days,

163
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,250
I think we are down playing
a bit the value of memory.

164
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,950
And, you know, I don't know about you but

165
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,530
I have all my phone numbers
entered into my iPhone.

166
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,540
I don't remember a phone number
anymore to save my life.

167
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,160
And, and people don't memorize
poetry anymore and, you know,

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,580
there's all sorts of things that used to
be part of the regular day to day life and

169
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,470
regular school life that aren't there so
much anymore.

170
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,360
And so I think we're a little bit
weary forcing ourselves to rely on our

171
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,730
memory at all.

172
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,400
But the thing that strikes me about
mind mapping is that if something is

173
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,660
interesting or important to you,
you're going to remember it.

174
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,040
At least you're going to remember
it well enough to mind map it.

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,080
And then, you know, of course when you
get to the point where you have to

176
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,240
do citations,
of course you have to look it up.

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,260
You have to get that 100% right, or

178
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,860
you're, you know, quoting someone else,
you, you need to check it, word for word.

179
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,090
But for doing the mind map, for
inspiring yourself to write, you're

180
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,350
not needing that kind of 100% accuracy,
you're just needing the inspiration.

181
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,800
And that's what mind mapping is so
valuable for.

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,070
>> I couldn't agree more and

183
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,870
I also couldn't agree more
about the importance of memory.

184
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,870
I think what we've done is.

185
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,420
Mistakenly by, by thinking,
well, memorization can

186
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,250
be sometimes a bad thing if you're
just sitting there memorizing things

187
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,020
without understanding them, but we've
thrown the baby out with the bath water.

188
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,350
We've said memorization is always bad.

189
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,440
And that's actually not true.

190
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,590
I mean great poets have said memorize
a poem because it helps you to,

191
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,950
to understand the underlying
meaning much more deeply.

192
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,240
And in the same way, when you memorize for
example an equation.

193
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,760
It can help you understand
that poetic under tone

194
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,500
that underlies the equation and,
and that's often lost.

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,050
But I have to bring out another something
you've alluded to in the past, and

196
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,180
that's simply the idea of when
you're trying to get into that

197
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,190
diffuse mode and I'm saying this
a little bit metaphorically because we

198
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,410
haven't truly analyzed what's going on.

199
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,810
But, but that, that mode where you're
stepping back a little bit and

200
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,680
you're not focusing completely and
intently.

201
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,640
But and you're trying to get
something down on a page.

202
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,020
That sometimes in order to avoid that
editorial mode, the best thing to do

203
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,310
is to cover up your screen with a,
a towel or something like that.

204
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,500
And that,
that helps prevent you from going back and

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,910
trying to edit what you just wrote and
just get it out onto the page.

206
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,090
>> Oh, absolutely.

207
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,170
You know that is the number one mistake.

208
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,140
That most students and
you know, not even students.

209
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,430
You don't have to be a student
to make this mistake.

210
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,180
Most beginning writers make is
they edit while they write.

211
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,110
And I like to say that that's
kind of like trying to

212
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,485
clear the table while
you're still eating dinner.

213
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:34,160
[LAUGH] It just doesn't work very well and

214
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,050
one of the tricks I suggest to people if
they've developed this habit is that they

215
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,040
turn off their monitor
while they're writing.

216
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,260
So you, of course you need to be a touch
typist to be able to do that, but

217
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,530
if you are a touch typists, then turn of
your monitor and if that feels to drastic,

218
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,060
or if you have a Mac that doesn't let
you turn of your monitor separately,

219
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,280
then just hang a towel over it, and write
without looking at what you're reading.

220
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,669
So, you know, I wrote for
probably 40, more than 40, 40 years.

221
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,010
While I edited constantly while I wrote.

222
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,680
And that was so dysfunctional and
so bad for me, and

223
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,240
it slowed me down so much and
made writing so difficult and

224
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,360
traumatic that I finally made the decision
that I had to break that habit.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,100
And so I started turning off my monitor.

226
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,030
I tried some other things as
well that also really helped.

227
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,460
There's a great app.

228
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,300
Up on the internet called write or die.

229
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,600
So it's write or die dot com.

230
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,890
And if you scroll down
that screen a little bit,

231
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,780
then you'll get to an area where
you can enter the number of

232
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,120
words you want to write and
enter a time limit for yourself.

233
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,150
And then you press a button that says,
I can't remember what it says, but

234
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,890
something like start.

235
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,631
And then you get a blank screen and
you start to write.

236
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,084
And what happens is,

237
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:03,251
what inevitably happens is we all, will
write a few words and then we stop and

238
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:08,920
we look off and stare into space while
we're trying to plan what to write next.

239
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,770
And what happens is the software
notices we're not typing and

240
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,850
after X number of seconds,
I think it's about 10 seconds,

241
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,200
of not moving the keyboard at all then,
the screen starts to pinken.

242
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,330
And I like to compare it to a blush.

243
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,070
because the screen's embarrassed for you.

244
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,180
And it gets pinker and pinker and
pinker the longer you go without writing.

245
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,830
And I haven't timed this in a long time so

246
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,200
I can't remember exactly
the time limit it gives you.

247
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,366
Let's say it's 20 seconds.

248
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:45,478
If you've gone 20 seconds
without writing at

249
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,130
all then you get a loud punishing noise.

250
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,830
So its either a crying baby,
a car alarm, or 70's disco music.

251
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,345
I'll leave it to you to
decide which is worse.

252
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:59,980
[LAUGH] But its a,
it's a very clever technique for

253
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,940
teaching you to break the habit
of editing while you write.

254
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,920
>> I've used Write or Die myself and
I think it does work very, very well.

255
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:17,210
I love this approach of separating
your editing from your actual writing.

256
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,600
For me, what I sometimes find is,
when I'm out, I'll think of something and

257
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm about to put it down, and
then I think oh, that's terrible.

258
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,300
I, I can't write that and then I'm
editing in my head before I'm writing and

259
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,060
when I stop that, when I just say okay,
I ought to get that out.

260
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,310
Hey, that's terrible, but
that's the way it is.

261
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,820
It's going to come out
on the page terrible.

262
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,930
I'm so surprised later when I look back,
and I find hey, you know what?

263
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,180
That actually wasn't as
terrible as I thought.

264
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,370
In fact, it got me started and,
and it's pretty good.

265
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,510
>> Yes, yes.

266
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,860
That, that happens to so many people.

267
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,630
and, and, you know, I have to tell you,
I have, I've taught writing for

268
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,680
so many years now.

269
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,690
I can tell you that when I talk
to people about that nasty little

270
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,780
editing voice that's in the back of all
our brains, we all have that voice and

271
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,250
it says the same thing to all of us.

272
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,520
It says things like this is no good.

273
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,110
My boss, or teacher,
is going to hate this.

274
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,970
This is boring.

275
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,930
This is really, really bad.

276
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:28,570
The, that, that voice says really negative
essentially unhelpful things to all of us.

277
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,770
We're all in the same boat.

278
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,510
So what I like to do,
is I like to talk back to that voice.

279
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,960
And I say things like,
could you shut up for a minute?

280
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,450
I don't have time to talk right now.

281
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,370
I will talk to you when I'm editing.

282
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,290
But I'm writing right now, I'm too busy.

283
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,860
And if you can be conscious of
that voice and talk back to it

284
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,955
rather than just let it yammer in
your ear, then you are better off.

285
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:57,495
So I think the number one technique for

286
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:02,655
dealing with that, is just recognizing
that it's happening, recognize,

287
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:08,235
recognizing that it happens to everyone,
and taking some steps to deal with it.

288
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:10,345
>> Well, I thank you so much, Daphne.

289
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:15,895
This was so useful, and
a fantastic reminder, even for me.

290
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:22,190

>> Thanks Barb.

298
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,050
Nice talking to you.
