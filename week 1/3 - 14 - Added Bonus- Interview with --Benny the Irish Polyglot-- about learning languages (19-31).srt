1
00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:12,020
When Benny Lewis turned 21,
the only language he spoke was English.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,170
Actually, he's done quite poorly
with languages in school.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,080
Truth be told, he initially had
problems even with English, and

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,430
had to go to speech therapy when
he was young because of it.

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,210
So Benny's not naturally
gifted with languages.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,300
He has a degree in electronic engineering.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,020
So, where I went from
language to engineering,

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,600
Benny went the other way around.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,680
Benny's love affair
with other cultures and

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,060
speaking foreign languages began in 2003
after graduation from the university.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,690
When he moved to Spain, he discovered
that learning languages wasn't so

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,290
hard when you apply the right method.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,650
In his current career as a full
time language hacker, over the last

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,930
dozen years, he has discovered people from
all around the world who have learned to

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,640
stop making excuses about why
they can't learn a language.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,730
And have instead learned,
how to learn a new language.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,450
I've read Benny's book, which is the best
book on language learning I've ever read.

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,030
His advice is absolutely brilliant.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,070
If you think you don't have the language
gene, or you're too old and don't have

20
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:25,300
time or are just too shy to try, Benny's
book will help you get past these hurdles.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,520
So it's a pleasure to welcome here,
Benny Lewis.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,450
Benny, your life is always filled with so
many adventures.

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,850
So, tell me what is your latest adventure?

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,370
>> My latest adventure is that this year I
am trying to make America multilingual and

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,280
other countries multilingual that
generally only speak English.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,830
And I am currently about one,
or 2,000 miles

27
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,020
into my 7,000 mile,
road trip across America.

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,810
I did the whole West coast to Northeast
and I'm going to every single state, and

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,199
I'm trying to encourage
people to learn languages.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,370
>> Wow, what an endeavor, and
what an important endeavor.

31
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,760
You know, you talk about people
sometimes wanting to learn languages for

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
the wrong reasons.

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,550
What are those wrong reasons, and

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,459
what have you discovered is a more
motivating factor for learning languages?

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,740
>> Right, well,
there are quite a lot of wrong reasons.

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,240
The worst of all is to show off, if you
think that I will learn this language so

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,220
people will think I'm smart, or people
will like me more or I'll be able to pick

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,620
up girls or anything along those lines,
then it's, it's not going to work because

39
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,420
I found that what you really do need,
is a passion for that language.

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,030
For the culture, you want to really
speak that language inherently for

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,960
the reasons,
of how fascinating that language is.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,940
And that's going to motivate you to,
to speak it.

43
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,400
If you have other things like you just
want, you just want to get an A in

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,730
an exam, or a B just so you can get into
university, then that's not a very good

45
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,470
motivator, because you are not actually
interested in using that language.

46
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,540
So, I highly recommend people
try to embrace the culture,

47
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,830
try to spend time speaking with other
human beings, and then you'll get the,

48
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,430
the motivation that's going to help
you to skyrocket your progress.

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,030
>> I like that approach.

50
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,410
You've talked about how children
have one big advantage,

51
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,580
can you tell us what that advantage is?

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,080
>> sure.
So, I think that the fact that

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,460
children are not so

54
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,100
much perfectionist like adults tend to be,
children are okay with making mistakes.

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,790
They kind of stumble and fall and
we, we help them along and

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,520
they play games in the language and
they live the language whereas,

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,700
in language learning adults tend to
study dusty old grammar books, and

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,110
can be so afraid of making mistakes
that they won't speak at all.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,590
And this is a huge mistake because,
in language learning it's not

60
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,310
like we visualize this in an academic
setting, where every mistake you

61
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,140
make gives you a red X and
if you make enough you make an F.

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,610
That's not the real world, in the real
world you can make lots of mistakes but

63
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,120
people will still understand you.

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,160
If I have just started to learn language,
you may think I should wait until I say,

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,170
excuse me kind sir, could you direct
me to the nearest bathroom please?

66
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,690
Or, I could just say bathroom, where?

67
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,420
And people understand that, that's
not a perfectly formed sentence, but

68
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,240
you have to be a good beginner learner.

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,390
And a good beginner learner, knows to make
a few mistakes, or a lot of mistakes,

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,960
to get their point across.

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,780
And I find children, that's the,

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,280
their main advantage is that they're,
they're okay with just saying something.

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,480
And they're not going to over analyze
everything that comes out of their mouth.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,140
The good news is, this is not an inherent
advantage that is built into them,

75
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,260
and not built into us.

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,400
It's just kind of the way children act,
and we can learn from that.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,920
We can learn to,
try to have some fun with our language.

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,330
Laugh at the fact that we're making
mistakes, and realize people are a lot

79
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,490
nicer that you think and
they're going to be very patient with you.

80
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,080
>> I, I think that's an important point,
is well of course,

81
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,260
just being willing to make mistakes,
making those mistakes, and

82
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,980
then realizing that most people
are actually pretty friendly and

83
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,670
accommodating, as you're learning and
adjusting and getting situated.

84
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,420
One, one thing that you've
talked about that I, I think is

85
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,620
a really important point is the idea
of self-fulfilling prophet, prophecies.

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,590
Can you talk a little bit about that?

87
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,064
>> Well for myself for instance,
I got into language learning as an adult.

88
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:01,810
But, I failed at five years
learning German in school.

89
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:09,490
I barely passed my exams after ten or
eleven years learning Irish And

90
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,630
I lived in Spain for six months and
I did not pick up, pick up any Spanish.

91
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,220
And I really truly, genuinely feel that
the reason this happened was because of

92
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,670
a series of self fulfilling prophecies.

93
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,310
When I was in Spain and 21 years old,

94
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,030
I told myself, you know,
I'm too old to learn a language now.

95
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,900
I passed this cut-off age 14, and

96
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,440
the thing is, it's a self fulfilling
prophecy because I believed this was true,

97
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,250
so I thought, okay, well there's
no point in doing any work now, so

98
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,460
I only put like minimal effort in and
because of that I don't make any progress.

99
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,380
And then I look at that lack of progress
and I'm like, you see, this just goes to

100
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,540
prove that adults are not good language
learners and it makes no sense,

101
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,870
when you actually look at it that way,
and it was the same in school.

102
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,440
In school I initially didn't do so
well on my exams, and I was thinking,

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,410
oh I can't do so well on these exams so I
guess there's no point in really studying.

104
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,640
And then of course I did
worse in my exams, and

105
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
it was just a constant feedback loop.

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,910
And like there's a quote from Henry Ford
that I like relevant to this,

107
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,970
he says, whether you think you can or
think you can't, you're right.

108
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,830
And I think that's the case with
self fulfilling prophecies.

109
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,050
People need to put these excuses aside,
that I don't have any time, you have,

110
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,350
you make the time.

111
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,220
I'm too old, you're not too old.

112
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,320
There are so many ways you can realize
that none of these are real issues,

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,380
that the actual reason you
haven't learned the language,

114
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,970
is your devotion to these reasons.

115
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,860
>> You say that successful language
learners learn, despite the challenges.

116
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,820
What did you mean by that?

117
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,180
>> So people have this idealized vision.

118
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,430
You know, the grass is always
greener on the other side.

119
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,450
They see someone who successfully
learned the language, and

120
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,060
they think to themselves,
this person has had it easy.

121
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,730
They must have had rich parents who,
who paid for tuition their whole life.

122
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,600
They must have just been
blessed to have had the right,

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
DNA to give them
the language learning gene.

124
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,450
They must have had it so easy and
just stumbled across native speakers and,

125
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,300
had a perfect situation,
this is simply not the case.

126
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,188
This is what we like to
tell ourselves once again,

127
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,190
in our self-fulfilling prophecies.

128
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,120
I don't have the ideal situation,
I don't have good luck in all of this and

129
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
the other person does.

130
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,830
And in talking to a lot
of language learners,

131
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,230
I have found each one of them have
their own challenges to to go through.

132
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,880
There are some really, well known
language learners on YouTube who are,

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,270
very impressive in their language
skills but they, they're family people,

134
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,550
they have a family to raise,
they may be working one or two jobs.

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,040
You know, it's not like they laze
around with millions of dollars and

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,750
just spend all day long learning
languages, they have their own challenges.

137
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,910
And I even came across a very
inspirational story of a lady

138
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,330
who's partially deaf and
clinically blind at the same time, and

139
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,720
she still managed to learn five languages.

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
So this shows me,

141
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,030
that no mater what the set backs people
have, they find a way around them.

142
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,360
And you know, and you can say oh, that guy
has it easy, because he can travel, and

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,390
I can't, but then find a way to learn
a language despite not traveling.

144
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,070
There are actually great ways
to get immersion virtually,

145
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,050
you can get Skype based
conversation practice,

146
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,700
you can listen to streamed radio
24 hours a day if you wanted to.

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,390
You could create a virtual
immersion environment.

148
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,360
But any one of the things are issues
that other people may have.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,370
You may have advantages that other
successful language learners,

150
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,700
may not have had.

151
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,130
You may be able to afford
a private teacher, you may be,

152
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,490
you may have spare time on your weekends,
when someone has worked two jobs, or

153
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,550
has a family to support, and
has less time flexibility.

154
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,510
So, every single person in the world,
has had challenges to go through.

155
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,540
And it's just unrealistic
to think woe is me,

156
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,860
I have this unfortunate situation
no one else understand.

157
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,830
I guarantee you no matter what your
problem is a successful language

158
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,359
learner has had that if not more
problems and still manage to overcome.

159
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:22,500
>> people sometimes have a history of
failure when they've tried to learn a new

160
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,920
languages, what do you say to someone
whose is failing when they're learning

161
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,110
a new language, and have you ever felt
like giving up in your language studies.

162
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,170
>> I felt like giving
up millions of times.

163
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,650
And even in my more experienced stages of
learning a language, and the thing is,

164
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:46,220
it's like I said before nobody has it,
has it super duper easy.

165
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,410
Including successful and
experienced language learners.

166
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,940
So at the very start, for instance,
when I tried to learn Spanish,

167
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,190
I tested out a lot of things that,
that were huge failures.

168
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,030
I spent six months trying to learn
Spanish, and I got nowhere in that time,

169
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,740
one of the things I did was I, I bought
El Señor de los Anillos, which is The Lord of the Rings.

170
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,930
And I thought if I just went
through this book page by page,

171
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,750
with the dictionary, then after I reach
page 700 I'd be fluent in Spanish.

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,290
I had this like, ridiculous idea and it
took me a whole week to get to page two.

173
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,580
So, when I was on page two,
I was thinking to myself,

174
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,040
it's going to take me a decade
to read this book at this rate.

175
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,290
And I was thinking,
I'm just, I'm just an idiot,

176
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,330
I'm not destined to learn Spanish or
any other language.

177
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,340
And even, like more recently a couple of
years ago I was learning Mandarin, and

178
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,690
I didn't find the Mandarin language
itself to be so complicated.

179
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,130
It's actually a lot,
straight forward than you may think.

180
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,150
But I was, learning it in the country,
which I actually do not recommend to

181
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,230
people, I recommend you learn
the language in advance via the internet.

182
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,270
So, that when you're in the country
you can experience the culture.

183
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,750
I think it's kind of a bit of a waste to,
be in the country to be in study mode when

184
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,900
you should out enjoying it, but
I at the time I was not, doing that and

185
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,240
I found it very difficult to adjust
to the cultural side of things.

186
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,460
And that slowed me down dramatically
on the language side of things.

187
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,720
So, no matter how experienced some one is,
they're going to run into problems,

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,270
they're going to get slowed down and
it's it's like anything.

189
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,190
If you've, if at first you don't succeed,
try, try, try again.

190
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,240
And like a lot of people in language
learning would reach a plateau, as well,

191
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,840
they may make a bit of progress and
get stuck.

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,290
And then they think I'm broken,
I'm not a good language learner.

193
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,440
And I found that,

194
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,370
that it's the exact opposite,
people need to try different techniques.

195
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,680
So my suggestion is people get into
speaking the language immediately.

196
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,510
I give tips for
people to speak from the very first day,

197
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,670
and then that may work for
you it may not work for you.

198
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,040
But you try something else and
if you still say after trying this out for

199
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,180
a few weeks,
I'm still not making any progress at all.

200
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,230
Then that doesn't mean you're
not a good language learner,

201
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,610
it means you're using a system
that is not good for you.

202
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,780
If you're studying a lot, and you're
not making progress, you may need to

203
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,040
abandon a study based approach, and try
to interact with the language a lot more.

204
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,160
So that's, that's what I'd suggest.

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,340
>> I love these ideas and
these approaches.

206
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,830
I know they were very helpful for
me with Russian.

207
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,360
In, in this course, one of the things
we talk about is the importance of

208
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,210
pushing your attention very hard.

209
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,330
For example when you're using something
like the Pomodoro Technique, and

210
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,010
then relaxing.

211
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,730
You talk about something like that, with
your mini-mission brain melting technique,

212
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,450
could you tell us a little about that?

213
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,380
>> Right, yeah, I, I'm actually a big
fan of the Pomodoro Technique as well,

214
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,670
I've used that a lot during
my intensive study days.

215
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,730
So I definitely agree with that,

216
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,610
I've tried to study all day, it just
doesn't work, you need little breaks.

217
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,160
But they then, that also applies over
the longer term, so when I was learning

218
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,770
some languages intensely over a couple
of months, then that's all my focus.

219
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm like, I've given up TV, I've given
up like, you know, going to the cinema,

220
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,620
going out and so on and I find, I reach
a certain point, where my brain just

221
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,910
feels saturated, and I can't really take
it anymore, and it's unfortunate, and

222
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,750
I try to study, but it just goes
in one ear, and out the other.

223
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,040
So, I applied this to the kind
of medium term scale.

224
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,360
And what I would do is, I would start,

225
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,330
like if I'm in an intensive learning
period, so this is not people who

226
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,440
are studying an hour a week, but people
who are studying like three or four or

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,900
more hours a day, so you're putting
every spare second you have in to it.

228
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,200
Then I would be working hard for five or

229
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,110
six days a week, and
then I would take one day off.

230
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,260
And I just repeat that process,
because if you it consistently for

231
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,790
too long, you you may over exert yourself.

232
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,120
So I'm, I kind of I find that I kind of
apply this Pomodoro Technique in over,

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,660
over several days.

234
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,720
And then, even bigger than that,
I would repeat this process for

235
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,010
four weeks, and then on at the end once a
month, I would take the whole weekend off.

236
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,560
So, so it's weird,
you would think you know, oh,

237
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,600
I just have to study intensively.

238
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,740
And once again, this is not something
necessarily true for everybody, but

239
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,650
I found that I, my limit is about
six days of consistent study, and

240
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,690
I need a little break, and then three or

241
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,240
four weeks of consistent study,
and I need a proper longer break.

242
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,200
>> Well, boring into some of
the specific details of how you learn,

243
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,770
you mention that, that rote rehearsal,
just repeating a word over and

244
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,230
over again, for example,
is not a good way to remember.

245
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,210
What is a better way?

246
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,040
>> It's not a good way to remember, but
it kind of, it kind of works a little bit,

247
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,760
I mean repetition is part
of learning any language.

248
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,150
But the catch is I see rote
repetition as very asymmetrical.

249
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,682
So, for instance,
when I was learning German, and

250
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:15,664
I saw that the word for
[NOISE] table is tisch.

251
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:20,361
So I just said to myself, tisch, table,
tisch, table, tisch, table, tisch, table,

252
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,760
whatever it was,
100 times, or 1,000 times.

253
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,700
And it kind of works such that when I was
reading German and I saw the word tisch,

254
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,820
I was like table, because I kind of
had that repetitive association.

255
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,940
And if I heard it spoken,

256
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,630
I would remember it, but there's a huge
downside is it doesn't work symmetrically.

257
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,000
It doesn't work the other way, if you
want to say the word table in German,

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,520
you don't have anything
that latches you to that,

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,900
you just have the tisch
kind of association.

260
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,710
So, in that case, I highly recommend
people consider using mnemonics,

261
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,480
because this kind of glues the word.

262
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,740
To your... to your memory.

263
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,100
So for instance,
in that example with the German tisch.

264
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,220
I would think to myself, okay let's
imagine, a table made out of tissues.

265
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,710
So I have you know, a table made out
of kitchen roll or whatever it is,

266
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,230
and I put a drink on it, and the table
collapses, the drink spills everywhere,

267
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,920
I have to get all of this,
all of these tissues and

268
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,690
I have to wipe it up because
it's created a huge mess.

269
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,890
So what that does,

270
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,410
is it puts this association in my mind of
visualizing a table made out of tissues,

271
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,220
so that when I'm speaking German, and
I want to say table, I can just think for

272
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,310
a second, the table was made out of
tissues, and I have that association.

273
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,900
So, you have a link that
connects the words you want,

274
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,310
to, to the words you want to say,
to the translation.

275
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,540
Now, the thing is,
you don't need to do this forever,

276
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,920
because you only need
the association a couple of times.

277
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,460
And then the word just becomes
a natural part of you.

278
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,600
So, there's a great website,
memrise.com, M E M (O) R I S E, and

279
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,780
this has people voting up their favorite
mnemonics, that's a great system.

280
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,330
Another one is, other than mnemonics,
I'm a big fan of spaced repetition,

281
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,370
so there's an app you can install
on your smart phone, called Anki.

282
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,770
And this presents
the words to you in a way,

283
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,560
that you see them just before
you would forget them.

284
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,440
And that's another problem with,
like memorizing a big list.

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,780
Is you may see a word that's important
to you, but you may not see it again for

286
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,530
a very long time.

287
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,440
And you may see the simple words over and
over again.

288
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,500
So when you use a particular system it
shows you the harder words way more

289
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,330
frequently, and
the easier words way less frequently.

290
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,390
>> I, I like your ideas of, not only
mnemonics but, creative mnemonics for

291
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,010
example with tonal languages.

292
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,750
You use the idea of something falling or
something rising in your memory tricks,

293
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,170
and I'd never thought of doing
something like that before, so

294
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,490
I think these kinds of ideas
are enormously helpful.

295
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,260
And actually in your book,
I have read your book, I love your book.

296
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,670
There are dozens and
dozens more helpful ideas, and

297
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,660
I could ask you dozens and
dozens more questions, but

298
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,970
I want people to actually read your book,
so I guess I'll leave off here.

299
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,560
And with that, I'd just like to thank
you so much for your wonderful and

300
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,359
very insightful answers.

301
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,200
>> Thank you very much, really appreciate
you having me on to talk to everybody,

302
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,290
giving them some inspiration.
