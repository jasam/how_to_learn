1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,860
Barb Oakley here,

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,750
I'm going to do a quick walk-through for
you so you see how to

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,570
handle all the videos and everything you
are going to be accessing, on our website.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,325
So when you first land, you'll probably
find something like this on the homepage.

5
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,720
This welcome to learning how to learn.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,850
Now, if you look at
the left navigational bar,

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,430
you'll see video lectures readings and
so forth.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,850
So, first thing you might want to do
is just go to the video lectures,

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,570
that's a key part of the course.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,680
Now I have special powers, so I get to
access everything right from the very

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
beginning, so you're seeing
actually right here you're seeing.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,960
Most of the lectures for Week One, Week
Two, Week Three, Week Four and so forth.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,130
So, now one thing you can do, is you can,
once you've completed a week,

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,600
see how you can press this arrow and
press it back, so

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,220
you can diminish the size of any
particular week, if you want to.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,590
And then, one thing I want you to do is
I want you to look over to the right.

17
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,520
And you'll see these wonderful
little images, which related to, for

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,660
example, Power Point's.

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,500
This is a Powerpoint, for the first video.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,980
This image right here,
takes you to the discussion forums.

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,920
So, you can see when you click on it,
you just go right to the discussion forum.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,960
Here are the, captions for the videos
right here and then you can download

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,550
the videos by clicking, right here and
and then it just shows up as.

24
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,700
As it's busy downloading.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,850
So, you can week by week
the videos will come available.

26
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,040
And you'll be able to see them.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,550
And so, there, you're kind of
getting a little preview here.

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,040
And then, what you can do is you
can go over to the reading section.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,690
And you can see that we've got lots of,
good stuff for you.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,970
Here's a little bit of background about A
Mind for Numbers, the book for the course.

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,290
And, of course,
you don't have to buy the book.

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,560
But it's nice to have in,
incase you want to look into or

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,590
sort of ingrain some of
the ideas more deeply.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,410
Here's one of the keep
aspects of the book.

35
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,140
And also of the course.

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,920
Which are some guidelines
about how to study and

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,110
how not to study because
you can fool yourself.

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,900
And then for
each week we also have a note for

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,490
readings that might be worthwhile for you.

40
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,920
All of these readings are optional and,
but they,

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,730
they just give you some nice insights
either into more popular articles or

42
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,030
heavy duty articles if you want
to take a look and see what.

43
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,090
What you might have an interest in.

44
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,760
Now the quizzes, as you go over
here you'll see the quizzes.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,710
Here's the quiz for
week one is right up there, and

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,040
you can just attempt quiz one
whenever you think you're ready.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,960
And week by week each quiz
will come available, and

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,240
then of course at the end
of the last week you'll.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,660
You'll have access to the final.

50
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,560
Now here are the peer or
the loop mate assessments.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,470
So if you go and just take a look,
there's, remember there's two assessments.

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,670
One is Assessment 1 and
the second is Assessment 2.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,650
And you can see all the details
about these two assessments and

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,550
down at the bottom of the page.

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,990
Are the actual assignments
themselves that you can go off to.

56
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:41,830
So then, there's a little bit here in the
About section, basics about the course.

57
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,260
So here's a little bit of
an introduction again, and

58
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,160
it pretty much repeats what's
on the introductory page.

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,640
And then a little bit more about
assessments and certificates.

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,280
And of course, the verified certificate
is a very nice way to go if you want to.

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,070
Really be,

62
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,170
show people that you've actually
learned the material in the course.

63
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,560
Here's a nice listing of
the actual course objectives.

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,950
And some frequently asked questions
that relate to the course.

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,890
And here's a little bit
of information about us.

66
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,470
There's Dr. Sejnowski right here.

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,700
And.

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,510
Then me.

69
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,330
And then we've got a number of learning
experts that we've interviewed for

70
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,840
the course.

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,770
So you'll see them as
bonus material interviews.

72
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,610
Here's our wonderful teaching assistants.

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,590
And you can see we've got
a great number of them.

74
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,640
And then a little bit about
the temporal dynamics learning center.

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,820
And finally our development team who have

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,500
worked very hard to help make
this course come to reality.

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,190
And there's a little bit here about you.

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,230
Right now,
I'm when I'm making this video, there's,

79
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,200
it's before the class
has actually started so.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,210
Pretty soon, this is going to
be populated with a lot of

81
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,930
different folks from all around the world.

82
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,700
And then, it, within a week or
so, we'll be giving you a survey.

83
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,890
And then we'll let you know what
the results of that survey are, and

84
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,840
they'll show up here.

85
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,660
Now, an important part of the,
the course, is the discussion forums.

86
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,150
So, the discussion forums,
they're right here.

87
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,780
Don't be shy.

88
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,500
And you can see, as I showed you earlier,

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,610
each of the video lectures actually
has a connection over to here.

90
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,900
So you can go directly here from the video
lectures, or you can come independently.

91
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,940
And then also, you can go from the quizzes
to study groups and hanging out together.

92
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,310
There's all sorts of different.

93
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,130
Aspects that you can meet people, talk
to them and get some insights from them.

94
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,470
Finally, there are some worthwhile
pages for you to go explore,

95
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,860
if you want to learn a little further;
just people I've found interesting and

96
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,890
worthwhile and
different websites and so forth.

97
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,870
So I think you'll find
this possibly of interest.

98
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,650
And that is almost all.

99
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,560
There's a little bit about meetups here.

100
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
You can go in and
learn about meetups and form a meetup.

101
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,460
And that's pretty much it for the course.

102
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,709
So that's your pocket
walk-through of our course.
