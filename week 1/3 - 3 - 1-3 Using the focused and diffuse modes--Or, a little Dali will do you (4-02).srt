2
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:08,332
So let's take a look at some famous people
from history who

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:13,530
used their different thinking modes to
help them with their problem solving.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,350
If you look at that guy right there, he
was Salvador

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,740
Dali, a very well known Surrealist painter
of the 20th century.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,710
He was the very definition of a wild and
crazy guy.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,530
You can see him here with his pet ocelot,
Babou.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,410
DalÃ­ used to have an interesting technique
to help

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,470
him come up with his fantastically
creative Surrealist paintings.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,070
He'd relax in a chair and let his mind go
free,

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,110
often still vaguely thinking about what he
had been previously focusing on.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,460
He'd have a key in his hand, dangling it
just above the floor.

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,938
And as he would slip into his dreams,
falling asleep,

14
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:01,265
the key would fall from his hand [SOUND]
and the clatter

15
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,909
would wake him up, just in time so he
could

16
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:08,089
gather up those diffuse mode connections
and ideas in his mind.

17
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:11,960
And off he'd go back into the focused mode
bringing with

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,530
him the new connections he'd made while in
the diffuse mode.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,650
Now you might think, well, you know,
that's okay for an artist, but

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,820
what is it have to do with more scientific
or mathematical kinds of thinking?

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,980
Well, if you look down here, this guy was

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,490
Thomas Edison, one of the most brilliant
inventors ever.

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,720
According to legend, what Edison used to
do was he'd sit

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,350
and relax in his chair, holding ball
bearings in his hand.

25
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:51,240
He'd relax away letting his mind run free,
although it would often

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,400
noodle back in a much more relaxed way to
what he'd been focusing on previously.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,573
When Edison would fall asleep, the ball
bearings would drop

28
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,952
[NOISE] and clatter to the ground just as
with DalÃ­.

29
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:09,185
And it would wake Edison up and off he'd
go with his ideas from

30
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:15,500
the diffuse mode, ready to take them into
the focused mode and build on them.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,260
So the bottom line is, when you're
learning

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,700
something new, especially something that's
a little more difficult,

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,230
your mind needs to be able to go

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,680
back and forth between the two different
learning modes.

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,430
That's what helps you learn effectively.

36
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,260
You might think of it as a bit

37
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,930
analogous to building your strength by
lifting weights.

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,970
You would never plan to compete in

39
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,260
a weight lifting competition by waiting
until the

40
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,210
very day before a meet and then spending
that entire day working out like a fiend.

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,660
I mean, it just doesn't happen that way.

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,350
To gain muscular structure, you need to do
a

43
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,200
little work every day, gradually allowing
your muscles to grow.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,220
Similarly, to build neuro-structure, you
need to do a little work

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,990
every day, gradually allowing yourself to
grow a neuro-scaffold to

46
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:20,990
hang your thinking on, a little bit every
day and that's the trick.

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,130
In summary then, we learned that analogies
provide powerful techniques for learning.

48
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,020
We learned about how the brain's two
different thinking modes, focused

49
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,690
and diffuse, each helps us learn, but in
very different ways.

50
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,950
And finally, we learn that learning
something difficult can take time.

51
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,300
Your brain needs to alternate its ways of
learning

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,050
as it grapples with and assimilates the
new material.

53
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,110
Thanks for learning about learning.

54
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,010
