00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,160
Everybody has some issues with
procrastination.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,360
Because if you're working on something, it
means

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,620
you're not working, on a lot of other
things.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,250
But some people have more issues with
procrastination than others.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,500
In this video, we're going to give you a
little insight into procrastination.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,870
Why it arises, and a powerful little tool
to help you address it.

7
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:30,340
When you look at something that you really
rather not do, it

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,270
seems that you activate the areas of your
brain associated with pain.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,540
Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a
way to stop

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,680
that negative stimulation by switching
your attention to something else.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,650
But here's the trick.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,330
Researchers discovered that not long after
people might start

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:57,310
actually working out what they didn't
like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,700
So it seems what happens when you
procrastinate, is something like this.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,670
First, you observe, and get a cue about

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,760
something that causes a tiny bit of
unease.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,030
You don't like it, so to make the
sensation go

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,060
away you turn your attention from whatever
caused that unease.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,380
You turn toward something more pleasant.

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,020
The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,400
We're going to talk more about
procrastination later on.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,760
But in the mean, time I'm going to let you
in on a handy little mental tool.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,150
This tool is called, the Pomodoro.

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,660
It was invented by Francesco Cirillo, in
the early 1980's.

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,230
Pomodoro is Italian for tomato.

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,960
The timer you use often looks like a
tomato and really,

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,940
a timer is all there is to this elegant
little technique.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,520
All you need to do, is set a timer

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,820
to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions,
and then focus.

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,100
That's it!

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,480
Most anybody can focus for 25 minutes.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,670
The only last important thing is to give
yourself a little reward when you're done.

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,580
A few minutes of web surfing, a cup of
coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,580
just stretching or chatting mindlessly,
allowing your brain

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,420
to enjoyably change its focus for a while.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,120
You'll find that using the Pomodoro
technique is very effective.

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,150
It's a little like doing an intense 25
minute workout at a mental gym.

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,150
Followed by some mental relaxation.

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,890
Give it a try.

40
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,990
Next, we're going to see how one very shy
ten year old, changed her brain.
