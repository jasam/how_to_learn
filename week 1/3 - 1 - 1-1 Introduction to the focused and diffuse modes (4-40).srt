1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,130
What do you do when you just can't figure
something out?

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,420
For zombies, it's pretty simple.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,350
They can just keep bashing their brains
against the wall.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,790
But living brains are a lot more complex.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,790
It turns out, though, that if you
understand just a little bit of some of

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,880
the basics about how your brain works, you

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,929
can learn more easily and be less
frustrated.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,840
Researchers have found that we have two
fundamentally different modes of thinking.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,320
Here, I'll call them the Focused and the
Diffuse modes.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,900
We're familiar with focusing.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,670
It's when you concentrate intently on
something

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,690
you're trying to learn or to understand.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,300
But we're not so familiar with diffuse
thinking.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,500
Turns out that this more relaxed thinking
style

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,330
is related to a set of neural resting
states.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,890
We're going to use an analogy of the game

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,850
of pinball to help us understand these two
thinking modes.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,850
Incidentally, both metaphor and analogy
are really

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,160
helpful when you're trying to learn
something new.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,940
If you remember, a pinball game works by,

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,800
you pull back on the plunger, release it,
and

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,930
a ball goes boinking out, bouncing around
on

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,890
the rubber bumpers, and that's how you get
points.

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,870
So, here's your brain, with the ears right
here, and the eyes looking upwards.

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,080
And we can lay that pinball machine right
down inside it.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,930
So, there you go.

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,480
There's the analogy for the focused mode.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,810
The blue bumper bumpers here are placed
very close to one another.

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,160
See this orange pattern here towards the
top?

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,200
It represents a familiar thought pattern.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,300
Maybe involving something simple like
adding some numbers, or

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,660
more advanced ideas like literary

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,340
criticism or calculating electromagnetic
flows.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,370
You think a thought, boom, it takes off,
moves smoothly along.

35
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,370
And then, as it's bouncing around on the
bumpers, you're

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,150
able to figure out the problem you're
trying to solve, or.

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,185
The concept you're trying to understand
that's

38
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:09,370
related to something you're rather
familiar with.

39
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,217
So look at how that thought moves smoothly

40
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:17,690
around on the fuzzy underlying orange
neural pathway.

41
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,690
In some sense it's as if it's traveling
along a familiar, nicely paved road.

42
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,410
But what if the problem you're working on
needs new ideas or approaches?

43
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,280
Concepts you haven't thought of before.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,814
That's symbolized here by this neural
pattern

45
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:38,310
towards the bottom of the pinball machine
area.

46
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,360
But if you haven't thought that thought
before, you don't

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,740
even know how that pattern feels or where
it is.

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,630
So how are you going to develop that new
thought in the first place?

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,330
Not only do you not know where the pattern
is or what the pattern looks like, but

50
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,310
see all the rubber bumpers that are
blocking your

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,380
access whatever direction you do decide to
move in?

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
To get to this new thought pattern, you
need a different way of thinking.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,730
And that's represented here, by the
diffuse mode.

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,495
Look at how widely spaced the rubber
bumpers are.

55
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:17,910
Thought takes off, look at how it moves
widely, bounces around.

56
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,430
It could travel a long way before being
interrupted by hitting a bumper.

57
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,360
In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can
look

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,660
at things broadly from a very different,
big-pictiure perspective.

59
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,790
You can make new neural connections
traveling along new pathways.

60
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,210
You can't focus in as tightly as you often

61
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,650
need to, to finalize any kind of problem
solving.

62
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,410
Or understand the finest aspects of a
concept.

63
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,070
But you can at least get to the initial
place

64
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,780
you need to be in to home in on a
solution.

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,060
Now as far as neuroscientists know right
now, you're either

66
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,560
in the focused mode or the diffuse mode
of thinking.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,670
It seems you can't be in both thinking
modes at the same time.

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,310
It's kind of like a coin.

69
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,170
We can see either one side, or the other
side of the coin.

70
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,320
But not both sides at the same time.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,040
Being in one mode seems to limit your

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,590
access to the other mode's way of
thinking.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,580
In our next video we're going to see how
some extraordinary

74
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,710
people access their diffuse ways of
thinking to do great things.

75
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,573
Thanks for learning about learning, I'm
Barbara Oakley.
