Hi, I'm Mary Ann, one of the TA's for
the Learning How to Learn Course.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,800
The first module is almost over and

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,670
I would like to take
a minute to encourage you.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,720
I can tell you from my own experience this
course has changed how I study and learn.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,390
Before this course I would study hard, but

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,200
no matter how much I studied I
couldn't retain what I learned.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,310
Honestly, I thought there
was something wrong with me.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,840
Then I took this course and I found
out it was the way I was learning, or

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,180
thought I was learning,
that was the problem.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,740
All these years of schooling,
including an undergraduate degree, and

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,480
a masters degree and
I never had one instructor show me

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,020
what the instructors in
this course share with us.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,730
Using the techniques I
learned in this course,

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,500
I now know how to retain
the information I want to learn.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,350
Participants in other courses
sometimes drop the first week.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,290
But don't do that in this course.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,540
You will lose out on
an opportunity of a lifetime.

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,580
Knowing how we can learn effectively
is a life skill everyone needs,

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,330
no matter where we are in life.

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,280
It's never too late.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,530
If you see me in the discussion forum,
say hello.

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,580
I'd love to hear your thoughts and how we
can help each other learn, how to learn.
