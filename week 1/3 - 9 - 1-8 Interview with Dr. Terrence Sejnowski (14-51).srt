1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,410
This video will be especially fun, because
I have

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,855
a chance now to interview my
 co-instructor, Dr. Terrence Sejnowski.

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:12,790
Terrence's pioneering research in neural
networks and computational

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,000
neural science, have made him a living
legend.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,160
Dr. Sejnowski is an investigator at Howard

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,250
Hughes medical institute, and the Francis
Crick

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,730
professor at the Salk Institute for
Biological

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,300
Studies where he directs the Computational
Neurobiology Laboratory.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,460
Above and beyond all of that Dr. Sejnowski
is

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,830
also in the elite group of only ten living 
scientists.

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,080
To have been elected to all three of

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,900
the national academies, in engineering,
science, and medicine.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,590
What I think perhaps is most impressive
however is that Terry

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,920
has also graduated more computational

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,770
neural scientists, than any other
scientist.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,938
In some sense then.

17
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,592
This makes Dr. Terrence Sinalski a leading

18
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,830
father figure for the modern field of
neuroscience.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,730
The ultimate goal of Dr. Sinalski research
is to

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,120
build linking principles, from brain to
behavior using computational models.

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,140
Today, I'm going to ask Terry a few
questions about how he learns.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,750
And how he thinks about learning, so that
we all might

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,060
get a better sense of how to improve our
own learning.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,300
So what do you do to help yourself learn

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,200
more easily, when your looking at
something completely new?

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,210
>> Well I like to get into the thick of
it.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,440
I don't get much out of just going and
reading a lot of books.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,870
And, when I was in Graduate School, I made
a transition from Physics to Biology.

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,100
And the way I did it was to get into a
Biology lab.

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,720
And get involved in experiments.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,270
And I, I'm a firm believer in learning by

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,690
doing, and learning by osmosis from people
who are experts.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,900
>> How do you keep yourself paying

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,385
attention, during something like a boring
lecture?

35
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:12,342
>> I found that there isn't, a simple way
to keep yourself

36
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:18,330
attending something that you're not
interested in.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,800
But I have found a little trick to waylay

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,110
the, the speaker, and that is by asking a
question.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,440
And the interruption often, gives rise to

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,850
a discussion that is a lot more
interesting.

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,570
And it actually follows the general
principle which is that

42
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,540
you learn more by active engagement rather
than passive listening.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,350
>> So, what do you do to get into and take
advantage of diffuse mode thinking?

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,840
I find that when I'm jogging, or out
getting exercise, that it's a wonderful

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,410
way to get the mind disengaged, from the
normal train of thought.

46
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,690
And I find that it's very very possible to

47
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,610
to sort of come up with new thoughts, new
ideas.

48
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,330
And it's almost as if your brain goes into
a

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,200
new mode, you're running along, things are
passing you by.

50
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,060
And you start thinking about what's
happening.

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,700
For example, things that, that your brain
has been working

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,700
on, your out of conscious thoughts bubble
to the surface.

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,670
And often new ideas that are going to be
then helpful to you later on.

54
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,740
The only problem I have is remembering all
those great ideas.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,560
Because when I get back and take a shower,
then a lot of them have evaporated.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,540
And that's why I, I like to take a little
notebook along with me,

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,099
so I can take notes and remember what it
is that I was thinking about.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,650
>> So, do you multitask, or, or if you
don't, how

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,300
do you resist the urge to multitask when
you want to multitask?

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,580
>> Well, I wouldn't survive if I didn't
multitask.

61
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,530
And most of my talking with students,
listening to lectures,

62
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,620
interacting with a lot of people who are
passing through, visitors.

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,760
There's just a lot things that are
bombarding

64
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,240
you, email, texting any these are very
important things

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,510
that you want to do, but if you can't

66
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,960
juggle them, it's hard to get through the
day.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,700
However, I, I enjoy the evenings when the
hubbub of the day quiets down, and I get a

68
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,220
chance to go into a, a more reflective
mode,

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,160
and that's when I actually get my best
work done.

70
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,470
>> Do you do two things at the same time
ever?

71
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,270
>> Well, you know, you can't actually do
two things,

72
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,840
consciously, at the same time, because
those will get mixed up.

73
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,170
It, its is possible with a lot of
training, actually, to do

74
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,346
two things at once, is, but it's, it's,
you're not doing it efficiently.

75
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:59,280
For me, multitasking is, is being able to
switch

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,500
back and forth, context switching from one
topic to another.

77
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,240
And some people are better at that than
others.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,650
In other words sometimes takes a while to
get into the swing

79
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,600
of things if you're in, in the middle of
writing a paper.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,320
For example it may take hours before you
get to the point where

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,470
you can actually be productive in

82
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,545
area, actually able to get something
accomplished.

83
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:25,520
But if, if, if you can you know after
getting lay you

84
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,260
know, into the middle of something
switching from that to another task.

85
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,110
Is, is sometimes very difficult to do, if,

86
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,560
if you're, if, if you're middle of
something.

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
But, I can do that very easily.

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,920
I can switch back and forth.

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,500
And I seem to be able to go back to the

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,920
original task, and, and, and take up where
I left off.

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,600
So, so that's one way of, of accomplishing
a lot and I get

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,070
I have, fortunately I have a lot of very
good students and helpers.

93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,770
And enormously productive environment that
I'm working in, so

94
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,280
it's been, it's really a joy to be here.

95
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,000
>> How do you apply your knowledge of
neuroscience, to your own learning?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,840
Well, you know, I think there are many
little ways that, I have applied what I've

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,620
actually learned in the lab, and let me

98
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,770
give you just one example to make it
concrete.

99
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,510
One of my colleagues at the Salk

100
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,920
Institute, Rusty Gage, made a very
important discovery.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,480
If you read the textbooks, it will tell
you that all

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,120
the neurons that you have in your brain
you had a birth.

103
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,750
And after birth, the wiring takes place
and learning,

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,080
and that changes at the, the connections
between the neurons.

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,890
But the, but they're the same old neurons
that you had when you were born.

106
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,200
Some die.

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,350
You know, so there is shrinkage of your,
of your cortex.

108
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,510
However, Rusty discovered that, in an
important part

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,120
of your brain for learning, and memory,
the Hippocampus.

110
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,860
And which is located right in the middle
here, of this model brain.

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,320
New neurons are being born, even in your
adulthood.

112
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,320
And, this, this is very important for
learning and memory.

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,790
It is obviously something that is very,
very

114
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,050
useful to be able to have new neurons.

115
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
Now here's what we discovered together.

116
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,260
We discovered that.

117
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,150
If you have a animal, we use a, a rat as
our model system.

118
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,760
And, if you give it an enriched
environment, in which the rat

119
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,010
is able to move around, and do things, and
interact with other rats.

120
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,550
That, and then look in the hippocampus,
you find that the hip,

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,050
the, the strengths of the connections

122
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,520
between the neurons, is much stronger
there.

123
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,880
It, it can be made by a factor of two,
much stronger than in

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,530
a rat that has been kept in a cage where
there is impoverished environment.

125
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,840
Now, and here's now the, the key, okay so
having an enriched

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,070
environment is, is, is even as an adult is
going to help you.

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,210
Right?

128
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,750
Instead of locking yourself, a monk in the
room you really

129
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,020
want to be surrounded by other people who
ar stimulating you.

130
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,360
And events that are happening that you

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,450
can actively participate in, so, so that
important.

132
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,470
Now here is something Rusty discovered
which I think is incredibly important.

133
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,630
That in the absence of an enriched
environment exercise will also

134
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,280
increase the number of new neurons that
are being born and survive.

135
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,560
And, so I, am very, avid at running.

136
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,110
I've already mentioned that I get lots of
good ideas when

137
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,610
I run, but I also, know, that my brain is,

138
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,280
helping me remember things, because of the
fact that I

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,670
have new neurons being born, and surviving
in my hippocampus.

140
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:57,440
So that's one of many examples that I can
point to,

141
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,560
in which what we've learned

142
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,520
about neuroscientists, from neuroscience,
has really

143
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,900
changed the way I think and its a pity if
you

144
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,020
look at the way our, our new educational
reforms and schools.

145
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,530
What do they cut out when they want to add
a new, a,

146
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,010
session for example learning something,
for example, how to pass a test, right.

147
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,710
Tests are being given now to help assess,
how well

148
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,598
a student is doing and how well a school
is doing.

149
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:30,990
Well, it's recess.

150
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,610
And what happens during a recess?

151
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,060
Exercise.

152
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,950
It's running around.

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,660
It's exactly what you need, what your brain
needs.

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,920
It needs that moment of pause of, of using
your muscles rather than your brain.

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,840
To be able to process that information and

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,480
to, and, and get the neurons working on
it.

157
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,930
So I think that this is, again something
that is, should be

158
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,170
a policy that we need to have our children
out there running around.

159
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,260
>> Have there been any special techniques
you've acquired over

160
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,070
the years that help you focus, learn or
create more effectively.

161
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,670
I find that,

162
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,390
being in a, a creative environment,

163
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,790
where other people, are, are

164
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,760
creative is, is, is a way of, enhancing
your own creativity.

165
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,460
I, I think that.

166
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,710
Although the image we have of the creative
thinker as being isolated

167
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,350
genius may be true of some people, it's
not true of me.

168
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,610
I really find that I have better ideas if
I'm

169
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,806
talking to somebody, and trying to explain
to them my ideas.

170
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:49,930
Often, that process can, it boosts

171
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,270
the creative process and the facts, I
think that you know,

172
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,510
having other people around to bounce

173
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,190
your ideas off of is really for me a very,
very important part of doing science.

174
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,500
>> How about test taking?

175
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,120
Any special advice there?

176
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,590
>> Tests are like any other skill.

177
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,790
You can learn them.

178
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,910
You can learn to be a better test
taker.

179
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,330
And you have a lot of good ideas
about that.

180
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:28,140
I've discovered that the... what
you need... things to avoid, for example.

181
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,280
Don't get hung up if you can't answer a
question.

182
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,960
Go on to the next, because you can always

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,960
come back and in fact, often, the answer
to

184
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,560
the problem that was holding you back may
actually

185
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,040
pop in to your brain later on in the test.

186
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,899
This is how our brains work, things work
along parallel tracks.

187
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,900
How do you approach your creative work in
science?

188
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
How do you keep yourself creative in the
face

189
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,840
of the onslaught of more routine day by
day tasks?

190
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,530
>> I've been very fortunate, because I
have

191
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,770
a great lab, and my students and colleagues,
keep me

192
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:20,010
young in terms of learning new things,
looking at things with new perspectives.

193
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,920
So, I think that having youth around
really

194
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,510
is a, a great way to keep yourself
youthful.

195
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,270
>> If you had any advice for a young high
school

196
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,870
or college student, about how to learn
effectively, what would you say?

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,520
>> That success isn't necessarily come by
being smart.

198
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,660
I know a lot of smart people who are not
successful.

199
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,920
But I know a lot of people, who are very,
very passionate.

200
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,800
And persistent.

201
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,410
A lot of success in life is that passion
and persistence, of

202
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,920
really staying the course, staying working
on it, and, not letting go.

203
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,320
Not giving up.

204
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,360
That's really, I think the most important,
quality that I

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,750
see in students, that I work with, who are
successful.

206
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,100
>> Terry, I cannot thank you enough, for
your

207
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,090
great answers, that I think people will
find very helpful.

208
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,940
>> Wonderful, now I want to, this is, give
a little intro here.

209
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,910
I'd like to introduce you to Francis
Crick's brain.

210
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,450
So, I first met Francis 30 years ago, and
this brain was sitting in his office.

211
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,610
And, Francis was a close colleague of, I,
moved here about

212
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,830
25 years ago, and got to know Francis much
much better.

213
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,640
And one day, we were chatting, and Francis
pointed out

214
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,900
this brain that had been sitting there for
decades and

215
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,210
said Terry do you know that I just
recently realized

216
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,270
that this brain is much bigger than a real
brain.

217
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,430
And in fact you could not fit this brain
in

218
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,560
my skull if you actually look at the
relative sizes.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,500
It's, it's, this is a teaching tool for
medical students.

220
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,860
You know, you could take apart the
different parts of the brain.

221
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,170
But isn't it interesting that Francis Crick
didn't realize that

222
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,370
until much, much later, when he actually
looked at it with new eyes?

223
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,810
And so, you know, this is something about.

224
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,860
Learning with fresh new eyes.

225
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,780
>> Isn't it extraordinary, even in a Nobel
Prize winning discoverer of DNA.

226
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,711
>> Well, there are things to discover
every

227
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,138
day about things around us, ordinary
things, that

228
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:43,628
you just have to look at them with

229
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:46,133
a different set of eyes and a different
perspective.

230
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:46,287
