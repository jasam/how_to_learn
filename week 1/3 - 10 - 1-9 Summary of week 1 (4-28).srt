00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,570
Although living brains are pretty complex,
this week we've

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,210
used metaphor and analogy and zombies to
help simplify matters.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,500
In essence, people have two fundamentally
different modes of thinking that,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,520
for the purpose of this course, we've
labeled focused and diffuse.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,030
We used a simple pinball analogy to

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,250
help us understand the differences between
the modes.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,360
The focused mode has tight spacing for the
rubber bumpers

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,610
which seems to, in some sense, help keep
your thoughts concentrated.

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,750
The diffuse mode, on the other hand, has
more widely

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,220
spaced bumpers that allow for more broad
ranging ways of thinking.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,210
The focused mode is centered more in the
prefrontal cortex, and

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,480
it often seems to involve thinking about
things you're somewhat familiar with.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,500
For example, if you're familiar with

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,730
multiplication and you're trying to solve
a

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:03,390
multiplication problem or you're trying to
find a word that rhymes with another word.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,500
You're probably stepping along the
somewhat

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,130
familiar pathways of the focused mode.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,910
But if you're trying to solve or figure
out something new, it

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,430
often cries out for the more broad ranging
perspectives of the diffuse mode.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,550
This mode, as it turns out, is

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,540
representative of the brain's many neural
resting states.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,310
Creative thinkers throughout history,
whatever their discipline, have found ways

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,490
to access the diffuse mode, often more
directly and quickly.

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,640
But we all access this mode quite
naturally when we do things like go

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,770
for a walk or take a shower or even just
drift off to sleep.

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,820
When we find ourselves stuck on a problem,
or even if

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,240
we're unsure of a situation in the course
of living our daily

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,530
life, it's often a good idea, once you've
focused directly on the

29
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,810
situation, to let things settle back, and
take a bit more time.

30
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,630
That way, more neural processing can take
place,

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,530
often below conscious awareness in the
diffuse mode.

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,990
The thing is, it often takes time for
neural processing to take place, and time

33
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,180
as well to build the new neural structures
that allow us to learn something new.

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,220
This is why tackling procrastination is so
very important.

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,620
The easiest way to tackle procrastination
is to use the Pomodoro Technique.

36
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,240
That brief 25 minute stretch of focused

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,450
concentration, followed by a bit of mental
relaxation.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,500
It's through practice and repetition that
we can help enhance and

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,410
strengthen the neural structures we're
building as we're learning something new.

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,550
Practice and repetition is particularly
important for more abstract topics.

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,370
Memory, of course, is an important aspect
of learning.

42
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,400
There are four slots in our working
memory.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,820
Things can fall out of those slots unless

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,490
we keep repeating them to hold them in
mind.

45
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,570
In that sense, working memory is like a
not very good blackboard.

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,000
Long term memory, on the other hand, is
like a storage warehouse.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,700
If you practiced and repeated something
well enough to get

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,160
it into long term memory, you can usually
call it

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,490
up later if you need it, although you may
need

50
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,750
an occasional bit of repetition to freshen
the memory up.

51
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,770
It's never a good idea to cram your
learning

52
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,060
by repeating things many times all in one
day.

53
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,850
Because that's like trying to build muscle
by lifting weights all in one day.

54
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,140
There's no time for solid structures to
grow.

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,500
We've also learned of the importance of
sleep in

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,600
washing away the toxins that develop
during our day's activities.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,470
You want to avoid taking tests or doing
anything difficult with little sleep

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,360
the night before, because it's like trying
to think with poison on the brain.

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,890
And just as importantly, exercise is
surprisingly valuable in

60
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,380
helping improve both our memory and our
ability to learn.

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,350
We've had a lot of fun while learning this
week, I'll

62
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,830
bet you'll find next week's material to be
even more exciting.

63
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning
how to learn.
