00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,670
Welcome to Learning How to Learn.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,780
My name is Terry Sejnowsky.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,390
Let me introduce you to your brain.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,560
First some brain surgery, we take off the
skull and take out the brain.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,610
This brain weights three pounds, but it
consumes ten times more energy

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,650
by weight then the rest of the body, a
very expensive organ.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,750
It is the most complex device in the known
universe.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,560
All of your thoughts, your hopes, your
fears, are in the neurons in this brain.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,910
We price our abilities to do chess and
math but it takes of practice

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,830
to acquire these skills and digital
computers

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,430
are much better at it than we are.

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,260
It came as a surprise to discover that
what we do so well and take

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,220
for granted, like seeing, hearing,
reaching, running, are

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,260
all much more complex problems than we
thought.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,120
And way beyond the capability of the
world's fastest digital computers.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,810
What this illustrates is that we are not
consciously aware of how our brains work.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,630
Brains evolved to help us navigate complex
environments.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,250
And most of the heavy lifting is done
below our level of consciousness.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,780
And we don't need to know how it's done in
order to survive.

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,600
Psychologists who study the unconscious
mind have found

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,909
that influences include thought processes,
memory, emotions, and motivation.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,800
We're only aware of a very small fraction
of all the activity in

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,850
the brain, so we need to rely on brain
imaging techniques to guide us.

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,950
Here is the activity map of someone's
brain who was

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,070
asked to lie still, at rest in a brain
imaging scanner.

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,450
On the left is the side view of the brain

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,584
and on the right is the view from the
mid-line.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,750
The colors indicate brain areas whose
activities were highly correlated, as

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,800
shown by the time courses below, color
coded to the brain areas.

30
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,380
The blue areas are highly activity when
the subject

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,660
interacts with the world, but turn-off in
the resting state.

32
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,550
The red orange areas are most active in
the resting state.

33
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,150
And are called the default mode network.

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,100
The default mode network is a leading
candidate for what we call the focus mode.

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,350
When you are quietly studying.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,550
The diffuse mode, which occurs when you
are not

37
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,220
concentrating, may be, not easy to
identify anatomically, but

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,530
it is likely to be a shift in the

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,710
resting pattern of activity towards a more
coherent global pattern.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,090
Other brightened areas are also more
active

41
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,750
when you are resting, and these areas

42
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,430
can be further divided into groups of

43
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,370
areas that have common patterns of
activity.

44
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,120
This is a new and intense area of
research, and it will

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,020
take time to sort out all the resting
states, and their functions.

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,670
There are a million, billion synapses in
your brain, where memories are stored.

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,880
The old view of the brain is that once it
matures, the strengths of synapses can be

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,270
adjusted by learning, but the pattern of
cognitivity

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,830
does not change much unless there is brain
damage.

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,130
But now we know that brain connectivity is

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,200
dynamic and remains so even after it
matures.

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,050
With new optical techniques for imaging

53
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,759
single connections between neurons called
synapses,

54
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,670
we can see constant turnover with

55
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,990
new synapses being formed and others
disappearing.

56
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,910
This raises a puzzle.

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,740
In the face of so much churn-over, how do
memories stay stable over so many years?

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,000
This is a picture of one dendritic branch

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,130
on a neuron which receives inputs from
other neurons.

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,740
The synapses are the spiny knobs coming
off the dendrite.

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,140
On the top the dendrite was imaged before
learning.

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,900
The same dendrite is shown below after
learning, and after sleep.

63
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,270
Multiple synapses that are newly formed
together on the

64
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,370
same branch are indicated by the white
arrow heads.

65
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,620
You are looking down into the brain of a
live animal.

66
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,510
This is really a fantastic new technique.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,330
Synapses are less than a micron in
diameter.

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,230
In comparison a human hair is around 20
microns in diameter.

69
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,250
This new technique allows us to see how
learning changes the structure of

70
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,910
the brain with a resolution that is near
the limit of light microscopy.

71
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,550
This illustrates that, intriguingly, you
are not the same person

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,680
you were after a night's sleep or even a
nap.

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,920
It is if you went to bed with one brain
and woke up with an upgrade.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,400
This is a better deal that you can get
from Microsoft.

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,746
Shakespeare, the great English poet,
already knew this.

76
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:54,912
Here is Macbeth lamenting his insomnia.

77
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,317
"Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of
care.

78
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:59,791
"The death of each day's life, sore
labour's bath.

79
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:06,476
"Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second
course.

80
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:09,998
"Chief nourisher in life's feast."

81
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:13,275
Here, Shakespeare is making an analogy
between knitted

82
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,076
clothes and sleep that knits up the loose
threads

83
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:18,673
of experience and concerns during the day
and

84
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:22,330
weaves them into the tapestry of your life
story.

85
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,754
You will learn, in this first week, how to
take advantage of your unconscious

86
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:31,190
mind, and also sleep to make it easier to
learn new things and solve problems.

87
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,230
During the lectures you may ask yourself,
how does the brain do this?

88
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,450
A good place to find out more about brain
is the website brainfacts.org.

89
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,172
Brainfacts, one word, .org.

90
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:45,550
You will find a wealth of interesting
things about

91
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,180
brains and behavior, and in particular
about learning and memory.

92
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm Terry Sejnowski.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,222
Happy learning until we meet again.
