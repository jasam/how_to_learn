1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,400
When I look back on my childhood or I

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,580
remember some words from Spanish or from
Russian, Здравствуйте, or

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,600
I bring to mind one of Maxwell's
equations, I'm drawing

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,790
on portions of my brain involved in long
term memory.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,610
But what I'm trying to hold a few ideas in
mind to connect them together

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,940
so I can understand a concept or solve a
problem, I'm using my working memory.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,240
Obviously, sometimes I'll bring something
from my long term memory

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,940
into my working memory, so I can think
about it.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,570
So the two types of memory are related.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,685
There are lots of different ways to slice

11
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:42,590
our understanding a memory, but for this
course on

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,390
learning, we're going to talk about only
these two

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,490
major memory systems, working memory and
long term memory.

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,190
Working memory is the part of memory that
has to

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,240
do with what you're immediately and
consciously processing in your mind.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,370
Your working memory is centered out of the

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,040
prefrontal cortex, although as we'll see
later, there

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,200
are also connections to other parts of
your

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,770
brain ,so you can access long term
memories.

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,580
Researchers used to think that our working
memory

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,220
could hold around seven items or chunks,
but

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,500
now it's widely believed that the working
memory

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,580
is holds only about four chunks of
information.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,620
We tend to automatically group memory
items in to chunks so

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,680
it seems our working memory is bigger than
it actually is.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,460
Although your working memory is like a

27
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,440
blackboard, it's not a very good
blackboard.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,320
You often need to keep repeating what you
are trying

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
to work with so it's stays in your working
memory.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,870
For example, you'll sometimes repeat a
phone number to

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,040
yourself until you have a chance to write
it down.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Repetition's needed so that your
metabolic vampires, that

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,230
is, natural dissipating processes, don't
suck those memories away.

34
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,280
You may find yourself shutting yours eyes
to keep any other items

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,360
from intruding into the limited slots of
your working memory as you concentrate.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,630
So we know that short term memory

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,860
is something like an inefficient mental
blackboard.

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,050
The other form of memory, long term
memory, is like a storage warehouse.

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,090
And just like a warehouse, it's
distributed over a big area.

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,080
Different kinds of long term memories are
stored in different regions of the brain.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,150
Research has shown when you first try to
put a

42
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,140
short term memory in long term memory, you
need to revisit

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,430
it at least a few times to increase the
chances that

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,660
you'll be able to find later when you
might need it.

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,420
The long term memory storage warehouse is
immense.

46
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,490
It's got room for billions of items.

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,980
In fact, there can be so many items they
can bury each other, so it can be difficult

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,250
for you to find the information you need
unless

49
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,460
you practice and repeat at least a few
times.

50
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,740
Long term memory is important because it's
where you store fundamental

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,650
concepts and techniques that are often

52
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,640
involved in whatever you're learning
about.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,280
When you encounter something new, you
often

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,570
use your working memory to handle it.

55
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,770
If you want to move that information into
your

56
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,430
long term memory, it often takes time and
practice.

57
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,270
To help with this process, use a technique
called spaced repetition.

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,470
This technique involves repeating what
you're trying to retain, but

59
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,030
what you want to do is space this
repetition out.

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,810
Repeating a new vocabulary word or a
problem

61
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,870
solving technique, for example, over a
number of days.

62
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,220
Extending your practice over several days
does make a difference.

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,360
Research has shown that if you try to glue
things

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,950
into your memory by repeating something 20
times in one evening,

65
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,800
for example, it won't stick nearly as well
as if

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,560
you practice it the same number of times
over several days.

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,790
This is like building the brick wall we
saw earlier.

68
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,070
If you don't leave time for the mortar to
dry, that is, time for

69
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,560
the synoptic connections to form and
strengthen,

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
you won't have a very good structure.

71
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,470
And talk about lasting structure, look at
this part of the Acropolis here.

72
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,080
Thanks for learning about learning.

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,969
