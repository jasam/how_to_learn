00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,140
Welcome to Learning How to Learn.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,310
Your brain has amazing abilities, but it
didn't come with an instruction manual.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,280
Perhaps the greatest gif that our brains
give

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,590
us is the ability to learn new things
everyday.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,170
On my way here, I thought about the
journey that will take us to

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,930
the last day of the course and how much we
will learn along the way.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,570
Our goal is to give you a better
understanding of

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,760
how we learn, so that your brain becomes a
better learner.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,800
These insights are based on solid

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,420
research from neuroscience, from cognitive
psychology,

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,010
and also from dozens of leading

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,570
instructors and practitioners in
difficult-to-learn subjects.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,730
Whether you're a novice or an expert, you
will find great new ways

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,820
to improve your skills and techniques for

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,449
learning, especially related to math and
science.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,000
>> This course is meant to help you
reframe how you

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,220
think about learning, to help reduce

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,780
your frustration and increase your
understanding.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,420
We approach things a little differently.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,390
You're not expected to have an in-depth
background in any particular subject.

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,110
Instead, you're expected to take these
ideas

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,610
and apply them to whatever subject you're
trying

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,970
to learn or improve in, to help you

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,640
learn more deeply, effectively, and with
less frustration.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,940
You'll hear experts from a variety of
different disciplines

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,670
talking about their best tips for learning
more effectively.

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,960
You can benefit from these ideas whether
you are struggling in high

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,490
school or soaring through math and science
at graduate levels at a university.

29
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,200
>> I'm a co-director of a science and
learning center that

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,670
is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation, based here in La Jolla.

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,570
In recent years, we've made great strides
from

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,380
research, in discovering how to learn most
effectively.

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,540
Finding a way to simply and effectively
share these ideas with you,

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,720
has been a big undertaking, but we feel
it's well worth doing.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,780
You'll see that many of these ideas,
although simple, are incredibly powerful.

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,620
And along the way, we'll also learn a lot
in the process of teaching you.

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,150
>> You'll see how you can fool

38
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,760
yourself about whether you actually know
the material.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,510
You'll discover new ways to hold your
focus and

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,070
embed the material more deeply and
powerfully in your mind.

41
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,255
And you'll learn to condense key ideas

42
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,269
you're learning about, so you can grasp
them

43
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,550
more easily, master the simple, practical
approaches outlined

44
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,820
here, including simple tips to help
prevent procrastination.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,470
And you'll be able to learn more
effectively and with less frustration.

46
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,780
This course is meant to enrich both your
learning and your life.

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,600
You'll able to get what you want from this
material.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,640
So, welcome to the course, and happy
learning.
