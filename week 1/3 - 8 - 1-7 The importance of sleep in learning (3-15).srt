1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,750
You might be surprised to learn that just

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,230
plain being awake creates toxic products
in your brain.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,310
How does the brain get rid of these
poisons?

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,600
Turns out that when you sleep, your brain
cells shrink.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,190
This causes an increase in the space
between your brain cells.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,590
It's like unblocking a stream.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,990
Fluid can flow past these cells and wash
the toxins out.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,320
So sleep, which can sometimes seem like
such a waste of

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,160
time, is actually your brain's way of
keeping itself clean and healthy.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,500
So, let's get right to a critical idea.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,780
Taking a test without getting enough sleep
means you're operating with

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,500
a brain that's got little metabolic toxins
floating around in it.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,780
Poisons that make it so you can't think
very clearly.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,330
It's kind of like trying to drive a car
that's got sugar in its gas tank.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,970
Doesn't work too well.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,820
In fact, getting too little sleep doesn't
just

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,700
make you do worse on tests, too little

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,900
sleep, over too long of a time, can

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,030
also be associated with all sorts of nasty
conditions.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,040
Including headaches, depression, heart
disease,

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,990
diabetes, and just plain dying earlier.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,480
But sleep does more than just allow your
brain to wash away toxins.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,950
It's actually important part of the memory
and learning process.

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,080
It's seems that during sleep your brain
tidies

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,500
up ideas and concepts your thinking about
and learning.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,610
It erases the less important parts of
memories and

27
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,680
simultaneously strengthens areas that you
need or want to remember.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,630
During sleep your brain also rehearses
some

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,340
of the tougher parts of whatever you're

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,270
trying to learn, going over and over

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,640
neural patterns to deepen and strengthen
them.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,720
Sleep has also been shown to make a
remarkable difference in your ability

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,600
to figure out difficult problems and to
understand what you're trying to learn.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,475
It's as if the complete deactivation of
the conscious you in the

35
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:16,500
pre-frontal cortex at the forefront of
your brain helps other areas of

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,120
your brain start talking more easily to
one another, allowing them to

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,370
put together the neural solution to your
learning task while you're sleeping.

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,710
Of course, you must also plant the seed
for

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,600
your diffuse mode by first doing focused
mode work.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,340
If you're going over what you're learning
right before you take a nap or

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,090
going to sleep for the evening you have an
increased chance of dreaming about it.

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,360
If you go even further and set it in mind
that you want to dream about the material,

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,800
it seems to improve your chances of
dreaming about it still further.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,220
Dreaming about what you're studying can

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,010
substantially enhance your ability to
understand.

46
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,690
It somehow consolidates your memories into
easier to grasp chunks.

47
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,030
And now time for a little sleep.
