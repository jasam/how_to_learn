1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,640
Dr. Robert Bilder directs the consortium
for

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,590
Neuropsychiatric Phenomics, which is a
team of

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,570
more than 50 investigators most centered
at

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,020
the University of California in Los
Angeles.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,730
This consortium aims to understand
neuropsychological

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,945
phenotypes on a genome wide scale.

7
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:27,538
Through a combination of human research,
basic research, and informatic strategies.

8
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:32,880
Basically, Dr. Bilder is digging to create
a fundamentally new understanding of how

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,570
to look at personality disorders and

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,100
diseases that have an effect on
personality.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,880
In this regard, Dr. Bilder also directs

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,300
and co-directs a slew of other important
centers.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,910
But of the most interest to us, Dr. Bilder

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,940
is the Director of the Tennenbaum Center
for the Biology of Creativity

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,810
one of the most
important programs

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,190
in the country involved in the study of
creativity.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,840
So with that, it's a pleasure to speak
here with Dr Robert Bilder.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,190
Thank you so much for joining us here
today Dr Bilder.

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,390
You're one of the world's foremost experts
on creativity.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,800
So I have a question for you, sometimes my
students will tell me.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,330
Now, wait a minute.

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,550
Other people have solved this problem
before.

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,810
So, if I think about it and figure out how
to solve this problem, I'm actually

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,390
not being creative while I'm solving this
problem,

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,350
because other people have already solved
this problem.

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,830
What are your thoughts on that situation?

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,220
>> Well, I think until you've solved

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,680
the problem yourself you haven't exercised
your brain

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,720
and made the unique connections in your

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,160
brain, that are needed to solve that
problem.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,790
So, we could distinguish between those
things

32
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,110
that are created for the world, which

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,420
that may not be creative with respect to
everything else that's been done before.

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,210
But if we think about what's been done
that's unique for you, something new

35
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,600
for you and that has value to you, then
that satisfies a criteria for creativity.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,140
And it's important for your, your brain to

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,860
do that in order to pursue other creative
problems.

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,890
>> Well, I couldn't agree more.

39
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,320
So I, I'm glad you made that point.

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,370
When you're trying to learn something new,
and you

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,110
speak publicly, sometimes you, like
everyone, is criticized for it.

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,050
What advice do you have for handling this
kind of criticism?

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,370
>> You know, someone told me something
that

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,650
I'm surprised I only heard a few weeks
ago.

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,400
And they said leadership is the ability to
disguise panic.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,780
And I think that if I had to think of all
of the occasions i've had when i've

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,520
had great concerns about what was going
on, or about handling criticisms, and

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,490
I think that it may only be through
repeated

49
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,800
experience that one learns how to cope
with that a little bit better.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,520
Always difficult but I think the only

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,340
advice I can give to others is to always
adopt the

52
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,920
same kind of curiosity about your own
shortcomings and

53
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,000
your own difficulty getting the big
picture

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,610
and understanding the entire scope of the

55
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,550
problem that you would apply to others and
to, to any problem in general.

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,120
>> I like that too, sort of be,

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,460
be willing to accept discomfort sometimes
because that's necessary.

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,580
You know, some people would say that it's
only when you

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,610
experience some discomfort that you're

60
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,730
actually accomplishing some kind of
change.

61
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,840
So, to the extent that one wants to make

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,740
progress, it's necessarily going to
involve some degree of discomfort.

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,930
That's the nature of change.

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,000
Physical change in the brain has to
involve some

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,179
work and that work has to involve some,
some discomfort.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,990
But I couldn't agree more.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,065
>> I'm reminded, my old swimming coach
used to say no pain, no gain.

68
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:03,300
>> [LAUGH]
Yes, indeed.

69
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,980
>> And that may also be true of the brain.

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,270
>> Sometimes those old proverbs are really
so true.

71
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,460
You know, that's why they're proverbs.

72
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,300
You have some very interesting

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,030
insights regarding creativity and being
disagreeable.

74
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,540
Could you give our viewers just a little
bit of insight about that.

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,950
>> Sure, sure so it's interesting that
when

76
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,460
we have studied personality it turns out
that their.

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,820
Our various models of personality, or
temperament or character.

78
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,620
But they pretty much all boil down to five

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,250
factors, and these have been very reliably
seen over time.

80
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,250
And the way that I find easiest to
remember those five factors is

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,720
to use the acronym OCEAN, which stands for
openness,

82
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,480
conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticisim.

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,290
And now that we've looked at that
personality characteristics of people and

84
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,890
then tried to relate their personality

85
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,530
characteristics to their degree of
creative achievement.

86
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,400
We find that there are two correlations
here one of them's not surprising at all.

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,150
Openness to a new experience is associated
with great achievement.

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,230
But then we find something that's perhaps
not quite as intuitive,

89
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,300
there is a correlation also with

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,380
agreeableness but that correlation is
negative.

91
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,330
So it means that people who are less
agreeable

92
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,560
or more disagreeable tend to show higher
creative achievement.

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,430
And I think that we might consider this to
be a facet of nonconformism.

94
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,040
Those who tend to challenge the status
quo, challenge models,

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,940
and don't believe things just because
other people have said them.

96
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,299
I think that these are our folks who are
more likely to be creative achievers.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,250
I think so, too.

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,200
That's, that's a very interesting and it's
a counter-intuitive finding.

99
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,750
>> Yes.

100
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,680
Usually people think agreeableness is, you
know, a nice, positive trait.

101
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,970
And, indeed, agreeableness is a nice,
positive trait.

102
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,860
yet, there are occasions when
disagreeableness.

103
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,400
Can push the envelope, help us to
challenge prior conventions and make

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,280
the kinds of pushes forward you know, that
are outside the box.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,660
>> I think sometimes it's just, it's hard
to

106
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,550
walk that fine line between being being a,
being agreeable.

107
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,700
Because things make sense.

108
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,090
And then sometimes stepping back and being

109
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,940
willing to be disagreeable because it
doesn't

110
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,530
make sense to you, and then sometimes you
find out, actually, it does make sense.

111
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,240
But sometimes, you're right to be
disagreeable.

112
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,300
So finding that fine line of where to
agree and where to disagree, and being

113
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,300
willing to disagree if you think that
something is not quite right,.

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,080
I think that's an important important line
to find.

115
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,700
>> Yeah, it's, it's difficult to know how
to balance the correct approach.

116
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,490
And indeed, I think that's one of the
cornerstones of

117
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,660
creativity, just by following from the
root definitions of, of creativity.

118
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,320
Which typically emphasize on the one hand
whatever the

119
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,920
product is, to be considered creative has
to be new.

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,170
But then it also has to be useful or
valued by someone.

121
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,570
So, this involves a kind of attention
between doing

122
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,200
something that may be totally driven by
your own

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,550
vision of things, and those things that
are going

124
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,220
to end up being adopted or used by others.

125
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,880
So it means that you can create things
that may be novel, wonderful, and strange.

126
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,660
But if they're too novel, too strange,
then

127
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,990
they're not going to be considered
wonderful by others.

128
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,660
So finding this sweet spot in the range
between what

129
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,050
you find to be the newest and most
valuable and exciting.

130
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,060
And what others believe is I think that's

131
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,090
a life long process of, of deliberation
and balance.

132
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,210
>> That's so true.

133
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,790
I, I think writers in particular, writers
and inventors are both,

134
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,080
they have to face what other people's
opinions of their work are.

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,935
And sometimes it's just surprising what
they'll come back

136
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:20,450
with, something that you thought was
perfect, a real gem.

137
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,780
People will come back and, and give you
insights that

138
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,200
allow you to understand that maybe your
perceptions weren't quite right.

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,258
>> That's right, yeah.

140
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:33,247
I've gotten that feedback you know quite
routinely,

141
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,770
and [LAUGH] may be a little defensive at
first.

142
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,830
And then, you know try to warm up to it,
and

143
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,049
try to understand well, what, what do they
have in mind.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,060
>> Any particular tips on how you learn
most effectively?

145
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,860
>> Well, I think people vary a lot in
terms of

146
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,949
the degree to which they are dominated by
words or images.

147
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,100
You know some verbal versus visual
learning styles.

148
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,570
And so I find that I do best if I can go
between the two.

149
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,570
Because I love words and language.

150
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,660
I was actually once accused by my students
of

151
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,110
being a sesquipedalian and got a little
plaque from them.

152
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,870
I didn't know what sesquipedalian meant
until I got the plaque.

153
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,940
And then anybody who watches this can then
look it up.

154
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,060
Anyhow I love words, and so there's a
nuance there that I really like.

155
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,980
But at the same time I feel like I don't

156
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,540
have a complete understanding unless i've
somehow mapped it, graphed it.

157
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,550
Or visualized it.

158
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,100
And so I like to go back and forth between
those two kinds of approaches.

159
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,270
The other thing that I really like to do,

160
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,730
and sometimes we've recommended this in
exercises to enhance creativity.

161
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,780
Is to do a powers of ten exercise.

162
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,360
And for those who haven't seen it, there's
a great video.

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,680
You can easily get it online.

164
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,390
Well you just look up powers of ten video
I think that will do the job.

165
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,408
It basically starts with an imagine of a
man sitting or lying in a hammock.

166
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:17,460
And then the camera zooms ten feet above,
then 100 feet

167
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,260
above, then 1,000 feet above, it goes by
powers of ten.

168
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,560
Ultimately you're exploring the cosmos in
outer space.

169
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,390
And then it zooms back down into the man.

170
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,900
Then it goes powers of ten inside the
skin.

171
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,250
Goes into the cell, goes down and reveals

172
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,180
the molecules, and then finally, and
what's really

173
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,870
mind blowing, is how far you have to

174
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,170
go when you start getting into subatomic
space.

175
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,900
Where you're really surrounded by
nothingness.

176
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,310
More vast than the universe itself.

177
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,260
So I think that getting that kind of
exercise, getting that perspective.

178
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,400
Trying to figure out what's the higher
altitude view, stepping back

179
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,810
from a problem and thinking about well,
why am I doing this?

180
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,260
What's the bigger picture?

181
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,840
But then also drilling into individual
facets and details,

182
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,500
by zooming in and zooming out from a
problem.

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,150
I usually find I get a much better idea

184
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,640
of the problem scope and different
perspective on that problem.

185
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,940
>> That is very worth while.

186
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,120
I've never really thought of problem
solving in that perspective.

187
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,280
I think that's maybe a little bit what you
do.

188
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,150
A bit subconsciousness or is it just

189
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,330
naturally when you get away from the
problem.

190
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,710
I mean, do you get new perspective when
you're just going out for a walk.

191
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,410
Or something like that?

192
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,550
But that's an interesting perspective.

193
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,460
Zooming in and zooming out.

194
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,440
>> I think the brain probably does

195
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,550
some of this spontaneously and
particularly during sleep.

196
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,210
Because if you think about what happens
during sleep.

197
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,320
You've got a washing away of all of

198
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,890
the conscious, top down, cognitive control
over your thoughts.

199
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,460
And it probably permits different neural
networks

200
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,890
to assemble themselves in ways that may

201
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,980
make sense spontaneously, but are free
from

202
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,930
the guided process of our top down mind.

203
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,410
And so I think that's one of the reason
why people will awake

204
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,680
from sleep, dreams, or other relaxed

205
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,740
states, when they're not thinking about
problems.

206
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,950
And all the sudden have come up with a
solution.

207
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,810
All components were there that required a
release at least temporarily of the

208
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,950
constraints, that would be applied to the
problem to recognize a new solution.

209
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,470
That may be how August Kekulé recognized
the benzene ring,

210
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,770
from seeing that snake biting it's tail.

211
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,810
>> Yeah I think it's sometimes, I like to
think of

212
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,240
it as an octopus of attention, and turns
off during sleep.

213
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,790
And so the tentacles of the octopus can
randomly go about

214
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,840
and that's what helps create some of the
innovative new ideas.

215
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,750
>> Well, that's interesting.

216
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,070
You were, I think you were reading my mind
because when I

217
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,600
was thinking of August Kekulé, who dreamt
about a snake biting his tail,

218
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,340
I was also thinking of well, what if
instead of a snake biting

219
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,330
it's tail, he imagined a spider, or it
could have been an octopus.

220
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,620
But, then we'd have a completely different
structure of organic chemistry before us.

221
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,170
We would never have discovered the benzene
ring.

222
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,620
>> Well that's what they say, insights
that rise from

223
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,130
the subconscious like that, they are, they
can sometimes be invaluable.

224
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,620
But you always gotta check 'em because
sometimes

225
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,729
they may seem right, but they're not
actually right.

226
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,736
That's right, yeah.

227
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:37,110
And there, you know, I'm mindful of
speaking of spiders,

228
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,690
the fantastic experiments that were done
in the early investigation

229
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,160
of LSD, the hallucinogen, where different
drugs were given to

230
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,409
spiders and see what impact it had on
their webmaking skills.

231
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,290
And while many people felt that they
became incredibly creative while under

232
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,370
the influence of LSD, and while many
people felt they had great

233
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,640
insights while they're under the influence
of LSD, the spiders it turns

234
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,840
out, made really lousy webs when they were
under the influence of LSD.

235
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,460
And I think a lot of people who had been
putting down

236
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,830
what they were thinking about at the time
that they were doing

237
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,200
LSD, found later, when they were no longer
under the influence, that

238
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,260
the products that they had created were
not exactly what they had hoped.

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,750
>> That's, that's, I think that's true,
there's

240
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,740
interesting perspectives from history of
different people's insights

241
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,560
whilst under drugs and not under drugs,
and

242
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,320
sometimes I think it's, it's actually
surprisingly good.

243
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,220
But other times, it's surprisingly
terrible.

244
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,670
So so there's definitely a mixture there.

245
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,270
>> This is, this is true.

246
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,820
I was just reviewing with a class
different kinds

247
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,200
of visual representations of dualities or
balances between opposing forces.

248
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,950
So we were talking about the yin yang
symbol, the Tibetan eternal knot.

249
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,580
But one of the symbols that's one of my,

250
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,690
one of my favorites probably because I
understand it

251
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,110
the least, is the intersecting gyres or
intersecting cones

252
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,712
that were described by Yeats and his wife
George.

253
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,242
And those, those images were probably
created

254
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,720
while they were under the influence of
opium.

255
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,845
>> I will definitely have to go look those
up now.

256
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,420
[LAUGH].

257
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,645
>> So, Doctor Bilder, I, I, I

258
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:34,485
so appreciate your, your an abecedarian
polymath.

259
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:41,330
[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]
So I greatly appreciate your

260
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:48,120
insights here, and on behalf of all the
students of learning how to learn.

261
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,160
I, I thank you.

262
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,800
>> Thank you, Barb.

263
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,715
It's always great talking to you.

264
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,919
